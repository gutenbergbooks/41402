<p><span class="smcap">Positively</span> every one, with two unimportant
exceptions, had called upon us. The Countess
had driven over from Sysington Hall, twelve
miles away, with two an&aelig;mic-looking daughters,
who had gushed over our late roses and
the cedar trees which shaded the lawn. The
Holgates of Holgate Brand and Lady Naselton
of Naselton had presented themselves on the
same afternoon. Many others had come in
their train, for what these very great people did
the neighborhood was bound to endorse. There
was a little veiled anxiety, a few elaborately
careless questions as to the spelling of our
name; but when my father had mentioned the
second &#8220;f,&#8221; and made a casual allusion to the
Warwickshire Ffolliots&mdash;with whom we were
not indeed on speaking terms, but who were
certainly our cousins&mdash;a distinct breath of relief
was followed by a gush of mild cordiality. There<a class="page" name="Page_2" id="Page_2" title="2"></a>
were wrong Ffolliots and right Ffolliots. We
belonged to the latter. No one had made a
mistake or compromised themselves in any way
by leaving their cards upon a small country
vicar and his daughters. And earlier callers
went away and spread a favorable report.
Those who were hesitating, hesitated no longer.
Our little carriage drive, very steep and very
hard to turn in, was cut up with the wheels of
many chariots. The whole county within a
reasonable distance came, with two exceptions.
And those two exceptions were Mr. Bruce Deville
of Deville Court, on the borders of whose
domain our little church and vicarage lay, and
the woman who dwelt in the &#8220;Yellow House.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked Lady Naselton about both of them
one afternoon. Her ladyship, by the way, had
been one of our earliest visitors, and had
evinced from the first a strong desire to become
my sponsor in Northshire society. She
was middle-aged, bright, and modern&mdash;a thorough
little cosmopolitan, with a marked absence
in her deportment and mannerisms of
anything bucolic or rural. I enjoyed talking
to her, and this was her third visit. We were
sitting out upon the lawn, drinking afternoon
tea, and making the best of a brilliant October
afternoon. A yellow gleam from the front of
that oddly-shaped little house, flashing through
the dark pine trees, brought it into my mind.<a class="page" name="Page_3" id="Page_3" title="3"></a>
It was only from one particular point in our
garden that any part of it was visible at all. It
chanced that I occupied that particular spot,
and during a lull in the conversation it occurred
to me to ask a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the by,&#8221; I remarked, &#8220;our nearest neighbors
have not yet been to see us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your nearest neighbors!&#8221; Lady Naselton
repeated. &#8220;Whom do you mean? There are a
heap of us who live close together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the woman who lives at that little
shanty through the plantation,&#8221; I answered, inclining
my head towards it. &#8220;It is a woman
who lives there, isn&#8217;t it? I fancy that some one
told me so, although I have not seen anything
of her. Perhaps I was mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton lifted both her hands. There
was positive relish in her tone when she spoke.
The symptoms were unmistakable. Why do
the nicest women enjoy shocking and being
shocked?</p>

<p>I could see that she was experiencing positive
pleasure from my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Ffolliot!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;My
dear girl, don&#8217;t you really know anything about
her? Hasn&#8217;t anybody told you anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stifled an imaginary yawn in faint protest
against her unbecoming exhilaration. I have
not many weaknesses, but I hate scandal and
scandal-mongering. All the same I was inter<a class="page" name="Page_4" id="Page_4" title="4"></a>ested,
although I did not care to gratify Lady
Naselton by showing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, that I have only been here a
week or two,&#8221; I remarked; &#8220;certainly not long
enough to have mastered the annals of the
neighborhood. I have not asked any one before.
No one has ever mentioned her name.
Is there really anything worth hearing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton looked down and brushed
some crumbs from her lap with a delicately
gloved hand. She was evidently an epicure in
story-telling. She was trying to make it last
out as long as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear girl, I should not like to tell
you all that people say,&#8221; she began, slowly. &#8220;At
the same time, as you are a stranger to the
neighborhood, and, of course, know nothing
about anybody, it is only my duty to put you
on your guard. I do not know the particulars
myself. I have never inquired. But she is not
considered to be at all a proper person. There
is something very dubious about her record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How deliciously vague!&#8221; I remarked, with
involuntary irony. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know anything
more definite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find no pleasure in inquiring into such
matters,&#8221; Lady Naselton replied a little stiffly.
&#8220;The opinion of those who are better able to
judge is sufficient for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_5" id="Page_5" title="5"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;One must inquire, or one cannot, or should
not, judge,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I suppose that there&#8217;s
something which she does, or does not, do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something connected with her past life,
I believe,&#8221; Lady Naselton remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her past life? Isn&#8217;t it supposed to be rather
interesting nowadays to have a past?&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to doubt whether, after all, I was going
to be much of a favorite with Lady Naselton.
She set her tea cup down, and looked at
me with distinct disapproval in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amongst a certain class of people it may
be,&#8221; she answered, severely; &#8220;not&#8221;&mdash;with emphasis&mdash;&#8220;in
Northshire society; not in any part
of it with which I am acquainted, I am glad to
say. You must allow me to add, Miss Ffolliot,
that I am somewhat surprised to hear you, a
clergyman&#8217;s daughter, express yourself so.&#8221;</p>

<p>A clergyman&#8217;s daughter. I was continually
forgetting that. And, after all, it is much more
comfortable to keep one&#8217;s self in accord with
one&#8217;s environment. I pulled myself together,
and explained with much surprise&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only asked a question, Lady Naselton. I
wasn&#8217;t expressing my own views. I think that
women with a past are very horrid. One is so
utterly tired of them in fiction that one does
not want to meet them in real life. We won&#8217;t
talk of this at all. I&#8217;m not really interested.
Tell me about Mr. Deville instead.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_6" id="Page_6" title="6"></a></p>

<p>Now this was a little unkind of me, for I
knew quite well that Lady Naselton was brimming
with eagerness to tell me a good deal
about this undesirable neighbor of ours. As it
happened, however, my question afforded her a
fresh opportunity, of which she took advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell you of one, unfortunately, is to tell
you of the other,&#8221; she said, significantly.</p>

<p>I decided to humor her, and raised my eyebrows
in the most approved fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shocking!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>I was received in favor again. My reception
of the innuendo had been all that could be desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;We consider it a most flagrant case,&#8221; she
continued, leaning over towards me confidentially.
&#8220;I am thankful to say that of the two
Bruce Deville is the least blamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that generally the case?&#8221; I murmured.
&#8220;It is the woman who has to bear the burden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is generally the woman who deserves
it,&#8221; Lady Naselton answered, promptly. &#8220;It is
my experience, at any rate, and I have seen a
good deal more of life than you. In the present
case there can be no doubt about it. The
woman actually followed him down here, and
took up her quarters almost at his gates whilst
he was away. She was there with scarcely a
stick of furniture in the house for nearly a
month. When he came back, would you be<a class="page" name="Page_7" id="Page_7" title="7"></a>lieve
it, the house was furnished from top to
bottom with things from the Court. The carts
were going backwards and forwards for days.
She even went up and selected some of the furniture
herself. I saw it all going on with my
own eyes. Oh! it was the most barefaced
thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about Mr. Deville,&#8221; I interrupted
hastily. &#8220;I have not seen him yet. What is he
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bruce Deville,&#8221; she murmured to herself,
thoughtfully. Then she was silent for a moment.
Something that was almost like a gleam of sorrow
passed across her face. Her whole expression
was changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bruce Deville is my godson,&#8221; she said,
slowly. &#8220;I suppose that is why I feel his failure
the more keenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a failure, then?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Some one
was talking about him yesterday, but I only
heard fragments here and there. Isn&#8217;t he very
quixotic, and very poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor!&#8221; She repeated the word with peculiar
emphasis. Then she rose from her chair,
and walked a step or two towards the low fence
which enclosed our lawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood by her side looking across the sunlit
stretch of meadows and undulating land. A
very pretty landscape it was. The farm houses,<a class="page" name="Page_8" id="Page_8" title="8"></a>
with their grey fronts and red-tiled roofs, and
snug rickyards close at hand, had a particularly
prosperous and picturesque appearance. The
land was mostly arable and well-cultivated; field
after field of deep golden stubble, and rich, dark
soil stretched away to the dim horizon. She
held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Does that look
like a poor man&#8217;s possessions?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every village there from east to west, every
stone and acre belongs to Bruce Deville, and
has belonged to the Devilles for centuries.
There is no other land owner on that side of the
country. He is lord of the Manor of a dozen
parishes!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do people call him so miserably
poor?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;They say that the Court is
virtually closed, and that he lives the life of a
hermit, almost without servants even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He either is or says he is as poor as Job,&#8221;
Lady Naselton continued, resuming her seat.
&#8220;He is a most extraordinary man. He was
away from the country altogether for twelve
years, wandering about, without any regular
scheme of travel, all over the world. People
met him or heard of him in all manner of queer
and out-of-the-way places. Then he lived in
London for a time, and spent a fortune&mdash;I don&#8217;t<a class="page" name="Page_9" id="Page_9" title="9"></a>
know that I ought to say anything about that
to you&mdash;on Marie Leparte, the singer. One
day he came back suddenly to the Court, which
had been shut up all this time, and took up his
quarters there in a single room with an old servant.
He gave out that he was ruined, and that
he desired neither to visit nor to be visited. He
behaved in such an extraordinary manner to
those who did go to see him, that they are not
likely to repeat the attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been living there?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;About four years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that you see him sometimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very seldom. Not oftener than I can help.
He is changed so dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what he is like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like! Do you mean personally? He is
ugly&mdash;hideously ugly&mdash;especially now that he
takes so little care of himself. He goes about
in clothes my coachman would decline to wear,
and he slouches. I think a man who slouches
is detestable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; I assented. &#8220;What a very unpleasant
neighbor to have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t the worst,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;He is impossible in every way. He has a brutal
temper and a brutal manner. No one could
possibly take him for a gentleman. He is cruel<a class="page" name="Page_10" id="Page_10" title="10"></a>
and reckless, and he does nothing but loaf.
There are things said about him which I should
not dare to repeat to you. I feel it deeply; but
it is no use disguising the fact. He is an utter
and miserable failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole,&#8221; I remarked, resuming my
chair, &#8220;it is perhaps well that he has not called.
I might not like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton&#8217;s hard little laugh rang out
upon the afternoon stillness. The idea seemed
to afford her infinite but bitter amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like him, my dear! Why, he would frighten
you to death. Fancy any one liking Bruce Deville!
Wait until you&#8217;ve seen him. He is the
most perfect prototype of degeneration in a
great family I have ever come in contact with.
The worst of it, too, that he was such a
charming boy. Why, isn&#8217;t that Mr. Ffolliot
coming?&#8221; she added, in an altogether different
tone. &#8220;I am so glad that I am going to meet
him at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up and followed her smiling gaze.
My father was coming noiselessly across the
smooth, green turf towards us. We both of us
watched him for a moment, Lady Naselton with
a faint look of surprise in her scrutiny. My
father was not in the least of the type of the ordinary
country clergyman. He was tall and slim,
and carried himself with an air of calm distinction.
His clean-shaven face was distinctly of<a class="page" name="Page_11" id="Page_11" title="11"></a>
the intellectual cast. His hair was only slightly
grey, was parted in the middle and vigorously
mobile and benevolent. His person in every
way was faultless and immaculate, from the tips
of his long fingers to the spotless white cravat
which alone redeemed the sombreness of his
clerical attire. I murmured a few words of introduction,
and he bowed over Lady Naselton&#8217;s
hand with a smile which women generally found
entrancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to meet Lady Naselton,&#8221; he
said, courteously. &#8220;My daughter has told me
so much of your kindness to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton made some pleasing and conventional
reply. My father turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you some tea, Kate?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I
have been making a long round of calls, and it
is a little exhausting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some, but it is not fit to drink,&#8221; I
answered, striking the gong. &#8220;Mary shall make
some fresh. It will only take a minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father acquiesced silently. He was fastidious
in small things, and I knew better than
to offer him cold tea. He drew up a basket-chair
to us and sat down with a little sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have commenced your work here
early,&#8221; Lady Naselton remarked. &#8220;Do you
think that you are going to like these parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The country is delightful,&#8221; my father an<a class="page" name="Page_12" id="Page_12" title="12"></a>swered
readily. &#8220;As to the work&mdash;well, I
scarcely know. Rural existence is such a
change after the nervous life of a great city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had a large parish at Belchester, had
you not?&#8221; Lady Naselton asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very large one,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I am
fond of work. I have always been used to large
parishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And two curates, I reflected silently. Lady
Naselton was looking sympathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find plenty to do here, I believe,&#8221;
she remarked. &#8220;The schools are in a most
backward condition. My husband says that unless
there is a great change in them very soon
we shall be having the School Board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must try and prevent that,&#8221; my father
said, gravely. &#8220;Of course I have to remember
that I am only curate-in-charge here, but still I
shall do what I can. My youngest daughter
Alice is a great assistance to me in such matters.
By the by, where is Alice?&#8221; he added,
turning to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is in the village somewhere,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;She will not be home for tea. She
has gone to see an old woman&mdash;to read to her,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father sighed gently. &#8220;Alice is a good
girl,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I bore the implied reproof complacently. My<a class="page" name="Page_13" id="Page_13" title="13"></a>
father sipped his tea for a moment or two, and
then asked a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of some one when I
crossed the lawn?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Some one
not altogether a desirable neighbor I should
imagine from Lady Naselton&#8217;s tone. Would it
be a breach of confidence&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;Lady Naselton
was telling me all about the man that lives at
the Court&mdash;our neighbor, Mr. Bruce Deville.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father set his cup down abruptly. His
long walk had evidently tired him. He was
more than ordinarily pale. He moved his basket-chair
a few feet further back into the deep,
cool shade of the cedar tree. For a second or
two his eyes were half closed and his eyelids
quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bruce Deville,&#8221; he repeated, softly&mdash;&#8220;Bruce
Deville! It is somewhat an uncommon
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And somewhat an uncommon man!&#8221; Lady
Naselton remarked, dryly. &#8220;A terrible black
sheep he is, Mr. Ffolliot. If you really want to
achieve a triumph you should attempt his conversion.
You should try and get him to come
to church. Fancy Bruce Deville in church!
The walls would crack and the windows fall in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My predecessor was perhaps not on good
terms with him,&#8221; my father suggested, softly.
&#8220;I have known so many unfortunate cases in<a class="page" name="Page_14" id="Page_14" title="14"></a>
which the squire of the parish and the vicar
have not been able to hit it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton shook her head. She had
risen to her feet, and was holding out a delicately
gloved hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No one
could hit it off with Bruce Deville. I was fond
of him once; but I am afraid that he is a very
bad lot. I should advise you to give him as
wide a berth as possible. Listen. Was that actually
six o&#8217;clock? I must go this second.
Come over and see me soon, won&#8217;t you, Miss
Ffolliot, and bring your father? I will send a
carriage for you any day you like. It is such an
awful pull up to Naselton. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gone with a good deal of silken rustle,
and a faint emission of perfume from her
trailing skirt. Notwithstanding his fatigue, my
father accompanied her across the lawn, and
handed her into her pony carriage. He remained
several minutes talking to her earnestly
after she had taken her seat and gathered up
the reins, and it seemed to me that he had
dropped his voice almost to a whisper. Although
I was but a few paces off I could hear
nothing of what they were saying. When at
last the carriage drove off and he came back to
me, he was thoughtful, and there was a dark
shade upon his face. He sat quite still for sev<a class="page" name="Page_15" id="Page_15" title="15"></a>eral
moments without speaking. Then he
looked up at me abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Lady Naselton&#8217;s description of our neighbor
is at all correct,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;he must be
a perfect ogre.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would imagine so. He is her godson,
but she can find nothing but evil to say of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under which circumstances it would be as
well for us&mdash;for you girls especially&mdash;to carefully
avoid him,&#8221; my father continued, keeping
his clear, grey eyes steadily fixed upon my face.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you agree with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most decidedly I do,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, notwithstanding his
evil reputation&mdash;perhaps because of it&mdash;I was
already beginning to feel a certain amount of
unaccountable interest in Mr. Bruce Deville.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="chap">ON THE MOOR</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> tea my father went to his study, for
it was late in the week, and he was a most conscientious
writer of sermons. I read for an hour,
and then, tired alike of my book and my own
company, I strolled up and down the drive.
This restlessness was one of my greatest troubles.
When the fit came I could neither work
nor read nor think connectedly. It was a phase
of incipient dissatisfaction with life, morbid, but
inevitable. At the end of the drive nearest the
road, I met Alice, my youngest sister, walking
briskly with a book under her arm, and a quiet
smile upon her homely face. I watched her
coming towards me, and I almost envied her.
What a comfort to be blessed with a placid
disposition and an optimistic frame of mind!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you look as though you had been enjoying
yourself,&#8221; I remarked, placing myself in
her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have&mdash;after a fashion,&#8221; she answered,
good humoredly. &#8220;Are you wise to be without
a hat, Kate? To look at your airy attire one<a class="page" name="Page_17" id="Page_17" title="17"></a>
would imagine that it was summer instead of
autumn. Come back into the house with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed at her in contempt. There was a
difference indeed between my muslin gown and
the plain black skirt and jacket, powdered with
dust, which was Alice&#8217;s usual costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever known me to catch cold
through wearing thin clothes or going without
a hat?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I am tired of being indoors.
There have been people here all the afternoon.
I wonder that your conscience allows you to
shirk your part of the duty and leave all the
tiresome entertaining to be done by me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with wide-opened eyes and
a concerned face. Alice was always so painfully
literal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought that you liked it!&#8221; she exclaimed.
I was in an evil mood, and I determined
to shock her. It was never a difficult
task.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I do sometimes,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but to-day
my callers have been all women, winding up
with an hour and a half of Lady Naselton. One
gets so tired of one&#8217;s own sex! Not a single
man all the afternoon. Somebody else&#8217;s husband
to pass the bread and butter would have
been a godsend!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice pursed up her lips, and turned her head
away with a look of displeasure.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_18" id="Page_18" title="18"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I am surprised to hear you talk like that,
Kate,&#8221; she said, quietly. &#8220;Do you think that it
is quite good taste?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be off, you little goose!&#8221; I called after her
as she passed on towards the house with quickened
step and rigid head. The little sober figure
turned the bend and disappeared without
looking around. She was the perfect type of
a clergyman&#8217;s daughter&mdash;studiously conventional,
unremittingly proper, inevitably a little
priggish. She was the right person in the right
place. She had the supreme good fortune to
be in accord with her environment. As for me,
I was a veritable black sheep. I looked after
her and sighed.</p>

<p>I had no desire to go in; on the other hand,
there was nothing to stay out for. I hesitated
for a moment, and then strolled on to the end
of the avenue. A change in the weather seemed
imminent. A grey, murky twilight had followed
the afternoon of brilliant sunshine, and
a low south wind was moaning amongst the
Norwegian firs. I leaned over the gate with
my face turned towards the great indistinct
front of Deville Court. There was nothing to
look at. The trees had taken to themselves
fantastic shapes, little wreaths of white mist
were rising from the hollows of the park. The
landscape was grey, colorless, monotonous. My
whole life was like that, I thought, with a sud<a class="page" name="Page_19" id="Page_19" title="19"></a>den
despondent chill. The lives of most girls
must be unless they are domestic. In our little
family Alice absorbed the domesticity.
There was not one shred of it in my disposition.</p>

<p>I realized with a start that I was becoming
morbid, and turned from the gate towards the
house. Suddenly I heard an unexpected sound&mdash;the
sound of voices close at hand. I stopped
short and half turned round. A deep voice
rang out upon the still, damp air&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get over, Madam! Get over, Marvel!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the sound of the cracking of a
whip and the soft patter of dogs&#8217; feet as they
came along the lane below&mdash;a narrow thoroughfare
which was bounded on one side by our
wall and on the other by the open stretch of
park at the head of which stood Deville Court.
There must have been quite twenty of them, all
of the same breed&mdash;beagles&mdash;and amongst them
two people were walking, a man and a woman.
The man was nearest to me, and I could see him
more distinctly. He was tall and very broad,
with a ragged beard and long hair. He wore
no collar, and there was a great rent in his
shabby shooting coat. Of his features I could
see nothing. He wore knickerbockers, and
stockings, and thick shoes. He was by no
means an ordinary looking person, but he was
certainly not prepossessing. The most favorable
thing about him was his carriage, which<a class="page" name="Page_20" id="Page_20" title="20"></a>
was upright and easy, but even that was in a
measure spoiled by a distinct suggestion of surliness.
The woman by his side I could only see
very indistinctly. She was slim, and wore some
sort of a plain tailor gown, but she did not appear
to be young. As they came nearer to
me, I slipped from the drive on to the verge of
the shrubbery, standing for a moment in the
shadow of a tall laurel bush. I was not seen,
but I could hear their voices. The woman was
speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;A new vicar, or curate-in-charge, here, isn&#8217;t
there, Bruce? I fancy I heard that one was
expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sullen, impatient growl came from her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, some fellow with a daughter, Morris
was telling me. The parson was bound to come,
I suppose, but what the mischief does he want
with a daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>A little laugh from the woman&mdash;a pleasant,
musical laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughters, I believe&mdash;I heard some one say
that there were two. What a misogynist you
are getting! Why shouldn&#8217;t the man have
daughters if he likes? I really believe that there
are two of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a contemptuous snort, and a moment&#8217;s
silence. They were exactly opposite to
me now, but the hedge and the shadow of the<a class="page" name="Page_21" id="Page_21" title="21"></a>
laurels beneath which I was standing completely
shielded me from observation. The
man&#8217;s huge form stood out with almost startling
distinctness against the grey sky. He was
lashing the thistles by the side of the road with
his long whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen but one&mdash;a
pale-faced, black-haired chit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smothered a laugh. I was the pale-faced,
black-haired chit, but it was scarcely a polite
way of alluding to me, Mr. Bruce Deville.
When they had gone by I leaned over the gate
again, and watched them vanish amongst the
shadows. The sound of their voices came to
me indistinctly; but I could hear the deep bass
of the man as he slung some scornful exclamation
out upon the moist air. His great figure,
looming unnaturally large through the misty
twilight, was the last to vanish. It was my
first glimpse of Mr. Bruce Deville of Deville
Court.</p>

<p>I turned round with a terrified start. Almost
at my side some heavy body had fallen to the
ground with a faint groan. A single step, and
I was bending over the prostrate form of a
man. I caught his hand and gazed into his
face with horrified eyes. It was my father. He
must have been within a yard of me when he
fell.</p>

<p>His eyes were half closed, and his hands<a class="page" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="22"></a>
were cold. Gathering up my skirts in my hand,
I ran swiftly across the lawn into the house.</p>

<p>I met Alice in the hall. &#8220;Get some brandy!&#8221;
I cried, breathlessly. &#8220;Father is ill&mdash;out in the
garden! Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought it in a moment. Together we
hurried back to where I had left him. He had
not moved. His cheeks were ghastly pale, and
his eyes were still closed. I felt his pulse and
his heart, and unfastened his collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing serious the matter&mdash;at
least I think not,&#8221; I whispered to Alice. &#8220;It is
only a fainting fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rubbed his hands, and we forced some
brandy between his lips. Presently he opened
his eyes, and raised his head a little, looking
half fearfully around.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was her voice,&#8221; he whispered, hoarsely.
&#8220;It came to me through the shadows! Where
is she? What have you done with her? There
was a rustling of the leaves&mdash;and then I heard
her speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one here but Alice and myself,&#8221;
I said, bending over him. &#8220;You must have
been fancying things. Are you better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better!&#8221; He looked up at both of us, and
the light came back into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I see! I must have fainted!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I remember the study was close, and
I came to get cool. Yet, I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="23"></a></p>

<p>I held out my arm, and he staggered up. He
was still white and shaken, but evidently his
memory was returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember it was close in the study,&#8221; he
said&mdash;&#8220;very close; I was tired too. I must
have walked too far. I don&#8217;t like it though. I
must see a doctor; I must certainly see a doctor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice bent over him full of sympathy, and he
took her arm. I walked behind him in silence.
A curious thought had taken possession of me.
I could not get rid of the impression of my
father&#8217;s first words, and his white, terrified face.
Was it indeed a wild fancy of his, or had he
really heard this voice which had stirred him
so deeply? I tried to laugh at the idea. I
could not. His cry was so natural, his terror
so apparent! He had heard a voice. He had
been stricken with a sudden terror. Whose
was the voice&mdash;whence his fear of it? I
watched him leaning slightly upon Alice&#8217;s arm,
and walking on slowly in front of me towards
the house. Already he was better. His features
had reassumed their customary air of delicate
and reserved strength. I looked at him
with new and curious eyes. For the first time
I wondered whether there might be another
world, or the ashes of an old one beneath that
grey, impenetrable mask.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="chap">MR. BRUCE DEVILLE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father&#8217;s first sermon was a great success.
As usual, it was polished, eloquent, and simple,
and withal original. He preached without manuscript,
almost without notes, and he took particular
pains to keep within the comprehension
of his tiny congregation. Lady Naselton, who
waited for me in the aisle, whispered her warm
approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever induced your father to come to
such an out-of-the-way hole as this?&#8221; she exclaimed,
as we passed through the porch into
the fresh, sunlit air. &#8220;Why, he is an orator!
He should preach at cathedrals! I never heard
any one whose style I like better. But all the
same it is a pity to think of such a sermon being
preached to such a congregation. Don&#8217;t
you think so yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed with her heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder that you girls let him come here
and bury himself, with his talents,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not much to do with it,&#8221; I reminded<a class="page" name="Page_25" id="Page_25" title="25"></a>
her. &#8220;You forget that I have lived abroad all
my life; I really have only been home for about
eight or nine months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should have thought that your sister
would have been more ambitious for him,&#8221; she
declared. &#8220;However, it&#8217;s not my business, of
course. Since you are here, I shall insist, positively
insist, upon coming every Sunday. My
husband says that it is such a drag for the
horses. Men have such ridiculous ideas where
horses are concerned. I am sure that they take
more care of them than they do of their wives.
Come and have tea with me to-morrow, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can,&#8221; I promised. &#8220;It all depends upon
what Providence has in store for me in the
shape of callers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one left to call,&#8221; Lady Naselton
declared, with her foot upon the carriage step.
&#8220;I looked through your card plate the other
day whilst I was waiting for you. You will be
left in peace for a little while now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget our neighbor,&#8221; I answered,
laughing. &#8220;He has not called yet, and I mean
him to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton leaned back amongst the soft
cushions of her barouche, and smiled a pitying
smile at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not wait for him, at any rate,&#8221; she<a class="page" name="Page_26" id="Page_26" title="26"></a>
said. &#8220;If you do you will suffer for the want
of fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage drove off, and I skirted the
church yard, and made my way round to the
Vicarage gate. Away across the park I could
see a huge knickerbockered figure leaning over
a gate, with his back to me, smoking a pipe.
It was not a graceful attitude, nor was it a particularly
reputable way of spending a Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>I was reminded of him again as I walked up
the path towards the house. A few yards from
our dining room window a dog was lying upon
a flower bed edge. As I approached, it limped
up, whining, and looked at me with piteous
brown eyes. I recognized the breed at once.
It was a beagle&mdash;one of Mr. Deville&#8217;s without
a doubt. It lay at my feet with its front paw
stretched out, and when I stooped down to pat
it, it wagged its tail feebly, but made no effort
to rise. Evidently its leg was broken.</p>

<p>I fetched some lint from the house, and commenced
to bind up the limb as carefully as possible.
The dog lay quite still, whining and
licking my hand every now and then. Just as
I was finishing off the bandage I became conscious
that some one was approaching the garden&mdash;a
firm, heavy tread was crossing the lane.
In a moment or two a gruff voice sounded almost
at my elbow.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_27" id="Page_27" title="27"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, but I think one of my dogs
is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were civil enough, but the tone
was brusque and repellant. I looked round
without removing my hands from the lint. Our
neighbor&#8217;s appearance was certainly not encouraging.
His great frame was carelessly clad in
a very old shooting suit, which once might have
been of good cut and style, but was now only
fit for the rag dealer. He wore a grey flannel
shirt with a turn-down collar of the same material.
His face, whatever its natural expression
might have been, was disfigured just then
with a dark, almost a ferocious, scowl. His
hand was raised, as though unwillingly, to his
cap, and a pair of piercing grey eyes were flashing
down upon me from beneath his heavily
marked eyebrows. He stood frowning down
from his great height, a singularly powerful
and forbidding object.</p>

<p>I resumed my task.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt it is your dog!&#8221; I said, calmly.
&#8220;But you must wait until I have finished the
bandage. You should take better care of your
animals! Perhaps you don&#8217;t know that its leg
is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got down on his knees at once without
glancing at me again. He seemed to have forgotten
my very existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lawless,&#8221; he exclaimed, softly&mdash;&#8220;little lady,<a class="page" name="Page_28" id="Page_28" title="28"></a>
little lady, what have you been up to? Oh, you
silly little woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>The animal, with the rank ingratitude of its
kind, wriggled frantically out of my grasp and
fawned about its master in a paroxysm of delight.
I was so completely forgotten that I was
able to observe him at my ease. His face and
voice had changed like magic. Then I saw
that his features, though irregular, were powerful
and not ill-shaped, and that his ugly flannel
shirt was at any rate clean. He continued to
ignore my presence, and, taking the dog up
into his arms, tenderly examined the fracture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little lady!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Poor
little Lawless. One of those damned traps of
Harrison&#8217;s, I suppose. I shall kill that fellow
some day!&#8221; he added, savagely, under his
breath.</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and shook out my skirts.
There are limits to one&#8217;s tolerance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are perfectly welcome,&#8221; I remarked,
quietly.</p>

<p>There was no doubt as to his having forgotten
my presence. He looked up with darkened
face. Lady Naselton was perfectly right. He
was a very ugly man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had quite
forgotten that you were here. In fact, I
thought that you had gone away. Thank you
for attending to the dog. That will do very<a class="page" name="Page_29" id="Page_29" title="29"></a>
nicely until I get it home,&#8221; he added, touching
the bandage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until you get it home!&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;Thank
you! Do you think that you can bandage better
than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked down with some scorn at his large,
clumsy hands. After all, were they so very
clumsy, though? They were large and brown,
but they were not without a certain shapeliness.
They looked strong, too. He bore the
glance with perfect equanimity, and, taking the
two ends of the line into his hands, commenced
to draw them tighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, I shall set the bone properly
when I get back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is fairly done,
though, for an amateur. Thank you&mdash;and good
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was turning brusquely away with the dog
under his arm, but I stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Harrison?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;and why does
he set traps?&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned, evidently annoyed at having to
stay and answer questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harrison is a small tenant farmer who objects
to my crossing his land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Objects to you crossing his land?&#8221; I repeated,
vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I take these dogs after hares, you
know&mdash;beagling, we call it. Sometimes I am
forced to cross his farm if a hare is running,<a class="page" name="Page_30" id="Page_30" title="30"></a>
although I never go there for one. He objects,
and so he sets traps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he your tenant?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get rid of him, then? I
wouldn&#8217;t have a man who would set traps on
my land.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned, and his tone was distinctly impatient.
He was evidently weary of the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot. He has a long lease. Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Deville.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know my name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Don&#8217;t you know mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me introduce myself, then. I am Miss
Ffolliot&mdash;the pale-faced chit, you know!&#8221; I
added, maliciously. &#8220;My father is the new
vicar.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was standing up before him with my hands
clasped behind my back, and almost felt the
flash of his dark, fiery eyes as they swept over
me. I could not look away from him.</p>

<p>There was a distinct change in his whole appearance.
At last he was looking at me with
genuine interest. The lines of his mouth had
come together sharply, and his face was as
black as thunder.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_31" id="Page_31" title="31"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Ffolliot?&#8221; he repeated, slowly&mdash;&#8220;Ffolliot?
How do you spell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, so long as you remember the two
F&#8217;s!&#8221; I answered, suavely. &#8220;Generally, double
F, O, double L, I, O, T. Rather a pretty name,
we think, although I am afraid that you don&#8217;t
seem to like it. Oh! here&#8217;s my father coming.
Won&#8217;t you stay, and make his acquaintance?&#8221;</p>

<p>My father, returning from the church, with
his surplice under his arm, had been attracted
by the sight of a strange man talking to me
on the lawn, and was coming slowly over towards
us. Mr. Deville turned round rather
abruptly. The two men met face to face, my
father dignified, correct, severe, Bruce Deville
untidy, ill-clad, with sullen, darkened face, lit
by the fire which flashed from his eyes. Yet
there was a certain dignity about his bearing,
and he met my father&#8217;s eyes resolutely. The
onus of speech seemed to rest with him, and
he accepted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no introduction to Mr. Ffolliot,&#8221; he
said, sternly. &#8220;I am afraid that I can offer you
no welcome to Northshire. This is a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father looked him up and down with
stony severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I am concerned, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
desire no welcome from you. Had I known
that you were to be amongst my near neigh<a class="page" name="Page_32" id="Page_32" title="32"></a>bors,
I should not have taken up my abode
here for however short a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sentiment,&#8221; remarked Mr. Deville, &#8220;is
altogether mutual. At any rate, we can see as
little of each other as possible. I wish you a
good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his cap presumably to me, although
he did not glance in my direction, and went off
across the lawn, taking huge strides, and crossing
our flower beds with reckless unconcern.
My father watched him go with a dark shadow
resting upon his face. He laid his fingers upon
my arm, and their touch through my thin gown
was like the touch of fire. I looked into his
still, calm face, and I wondered. It was marvellous
that a man should wear such a mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have known him?&#8221; I murmured.
&#8220;Where? Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>My father drew a long, inward breath
through his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; he said, slowly, with his eyes
still fixed upon the now distant figure, &#8220;was
closely, very closely, associated with the most
unhappy chapter of my life. It was all over and
done with before you were old enough to understand.
It is many, many years ago, but I
felt in his presence as though it were but yesterday.
It is many years ago&mdash;but it hurts still&mdash;like
a knife it hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his hand pressed convulsively to his<a class="page" name="Page_33" id="Page_33" title="33"></a>
side, and stood watching the grey, stalwart figure
now almost out of sight. His face was white
and strained&mdash;some symptoms of yesterday&#8217;s
faintness seemed to be suggested by those wan
cheeks and over bright eyes. Even I, naturally
unsympathetic and callous, was moved. I
laid my hand upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is over and finished, you say, this dark
chapter,&#8221; I whispered, softly. &#8220;I would not
think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment in silence.
The grey pallor still lingered in his thin, sunken
cheeks, and his eyes were like cold fires. It
was a face which might well guard its own secrets.
I looked into it, and felt a vague sense
of trouble stirring within me. Was that chapter
of his life turned over and done with forever?
Was that secret at which he had hinted,
and the knowledge of which lay between these
two, wholly of the past, or was it a live thing?
I could not tell. My father was fast becoming
the enigma of my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot cease to think about it,&#8221; he said,
slowly. &#8220;I shall never cease to think about it
until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until when?&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until the end,&#8221; he cried, hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;until
the end, and God grant that it may not be long.&#8221;</p>

<span class="chap">OUR MYSTERIOUS NEIGHBORS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a faithful and exact account of my
meeting with the first of those two of our neighbors
who seemed, according to Lady Naselton&#8217;s
report, to remain entirely outside the ordinary
society of the place. Curiously enough,
my meeting with the second one occurred on
the very next afternoon.</p>

<p>We came face to face at a turning in the wood
within a few yards of her odd little house, and
the surprise of it almost took my breath away.
Could this be the woman condemned to isolation
by a whole neighborhood&mdash;the woman on
whose shoulders lay the burden of Bruce Deville&#8217;s
profligacy? I looked into the clear, dark
eyes which met mine without any shadow of
embarrassment&mdash;returning in some measure
the keen interest of my own scrutiny&mdash;and the
thing seemed impossible.</p>

<p>She spoke to me graciously, and as though
to do so were quite a matter of course. Her
voice completed my subjugation. One may so
often be deceived by faces, but the voice seems
an infallible test.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_35" id="Page_35" title="35"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;There is going to be a terrible storm,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in for a few minutes?
You will scarcely be able to get home, and
these trees are not safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even while she was speaking the big rain
drops began to fall. I gathered up my skirts,
and hurried along by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very good of you,&#8221; I said, breathlessly.
&#8220;I am dreadfully afraid of a thunderstorm.&#8221;</p>

<p>We crossed the trim little lawn, and in a moment
I had passed the portals of the Yellow
House. The front door opened into a low,
square hall, hung with old-fashioned engravings
against a background of dark oak. There
were rugs upon the polished floor, and several
easy chairs and lounges. By the side of one was
a box from Mudie&#8217;s, evidently just arrived, and
a small wood fire was burning in the open
grate. She laid her hand on the back of a low
rocking chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we sit here?&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;We
can keep the door open and watch the storm.
Or perhaps you would rather see as little of it
as possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the easy chair opposite to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind watching it from inside,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I am not really nervous, but those
trees look horribly unsafe. One wants to be
on the moor to enjoy a thunderstorm.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_36" id="Page_36" title="36"></a></p>

<p>She looked at me with a faint smile, kindly
but critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t look particularly nervous,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A crash of thunder drowned the rest of her
sentence.</p>

<p>In the silence which followed I found her
studying my features intently. For some reason
or other she seemed suddenly to have developed
a new and strong interest in me. Her
eyes were fastened upon my face. I began to
feel almost uncomfortable.</p>

<p>She suddenly realized it, and broke into a
little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive my staring at you so outrageously,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;You must think me a very
rude person. It is odd to meet any one in the
woods about here, you know; and I don&#8217;t think
that I have ever seen you before, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not; unless you were at church
yesterday,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I certainly have not, for I do not attend
church,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t
live in church, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; but we have only been here a week
or so,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;My name is Kate Ffolliot.
I am the daughter of the new vicar, or, rather,
curate-in-charge.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_37" id="Page_37" title="37"></a></p>

<p>Once more the hall was filled with white
light.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s breathless silence, and
then the thunder came crashing over our heads.
When it was over she was leaning forward with
her face buried in her hands. She did not look
up immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thunder is awful!&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;I
never heard it more directly overhead. I am
afraid it is making you uncomfortable, is it
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not move her hands or answer me. I
rose to my feet, frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Are you
ill? Shall I call any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked at me, motioning
me to sit down with a little wave of her
hand. Evidently the storm had affected her
nerves. Her face was paler than ever save
where her clenched fingers seemed to have cut
into her cheeks and left red livid marks on
either side. Her dark eyes were unnaturally
bright and dry. She had lost that dignified serenity
of manner which had first impressed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; please sit down,&#8221; she said, softly. &#8220;I
am all right&mdash;only very foolish. That last crash
was too awful. It was silly of me to mind,
though. I have seen worse storms. It is a sign
of advancing age, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_38" id="Page_38" title="38"></a></p>

<p>I laughed. She was still regarding me fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are neighbors, Miss Ffolliot?&#8221; she
remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Close ones,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;There is only a
little belt of trees between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have guessed who you were,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;For the moment, though, it did not occur
to me. You are not,&#8221; she said, with a
faint smile, &#8220;at all what one looks for in a
country clergyman&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lived abroad nearly all my life,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;I was at school in Berlin and Heidelberg.
My sister has always been my father&#8217;s
helper. I am afraid that parish work does not
appeal to me at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not surprised at that,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;One needs a special disposition to interest
one&#8217;s self in those things, and, without being a
physiognomist, I can tell you that you have not
got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People in the country are so stupid, and
they take so much for granted,&#8221; I remarked.
&#8220;If I were a philanthropist, I should certainly
choose to work in a city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; she answered, absently.
&#8220;Work amongst people who have
learned to think a little for themselves is more
inspiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were silent for a moment or two. She<a class="page" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" title="39"></a>
was evidently not interested in the discussion,
so I did not attempt to carry it on. I turned
a little in my chair to watch the storm outside,
conscious all the time that her eyes scarcely left
my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had grown so used,&#8221; she said, presently,
&#8220;to the rectory being empty, that I had quite
forgotten the possibility of its being occupied
again. The vicar used to live several miles
away. I wonder that Mr. Deville did not know
anything about you&mdash;that he did not know your
name, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I was sorry that she had mentioned Mr.
Deville. I was doing my best to forget all that
I had heard from Lady Naselton, and to form
an independent judgment; but at her words the
whole substance of it returned to me with a
rush. I leaned back in my chair, and looked at
her thoughtfully. She was a woman whose age
might be anything between thirty-five and
forty. She was plainly dressed, but with a
quiet elegance which forbade any idea of a country
dressmaker. She was too thin for her figure
to be considered in any way good; but she was
tall and graceful in all her movements. Her
thick, brown hair, touched here and there with
grey, was parted in the middle and vigorously
brushed away from a low, thoughtful forehead,
over which it showed a decided propensity to
wave. Her features were good and strongly<a class="page" name="Page_40" id="Page_40" title="40"></a>
marked, and her skin was perfect. Her eyes
were bright and dark, her mouth piquant and
humorous. She had no pretence to beauty, but
she was certainly a very attractive and a very
well-bred woman. I had never in all my life
seen any one who suggested less those things
at which Lady Naselton had hinted.</p>

<p>Perhaps she saw the slight change in my
face at Mr. Deville&#8217;s name. At any rate, she
turned the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been living in the country before
you came here, or near a large city?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;You will find it very quiet here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came from Belchester,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;My father had a church in the suburbs there.
It was very horrid; I was not there long, but I
hated it. I think the most desolate country
region in the world is better than suburbanism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I agree with you,&#8221; she
smiled. &#8220;In a large community at any rate you
are closer to the problems of life. I was at Belchester
not long ago, and I found it very interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were at Belchester!&#8221; I repeated in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I was electioneering. I came to help
Mr. Densham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! The Socialist!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_41" id="Page_41" title="41"></a></p>

<p>She nodded, and I could see that the corners
of her mouth were twitching with amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I thought that Belchester was rather
an enlightened place. We polled over four
thousand votes. I think if we had another week
or two, and a few less helpers we might have
got Mr. Densham in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few less helpers!&#8221; I repeated, aimlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That is the worst of Labor and Socialist
meetings. There is such a terrible craving
amongst the working classes to become
stump orators. You cannot teach them to hold
their tongues. They make silly speeches, and
of course the newspapers on the other side report
them, and we get the discredit of their
opinions. One always suffers most at the hands
of one&#8217;s friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her in silent wonder. I, too, had
helped at that election&mdash;that is to say, I had
driven about in the Countess of Applecorn&#8217;s
barouche with a great bunch of cornflower in
my gown, and talked amiably to a lot of uninteresting
people. I had a dim recollection of a
one-horse wagonette which we had passed on
the way preceded by a brass band and a lot of
factory hands, and of Lady Applecorn raising
her gold-rimmed eyeglass and saying something
about the Socialist candidate.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_42" id="Page_42" title="42"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Did you make speeches&mdash;and that sort of
thing?&#8221; I asked, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>She laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did. How else could I have
helped? I am afraid that you are beginning
to think that I am a very terrible person,&#8221; she
added, with a decided twinkle in her rich brown
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; I begged. &#8220;Only I
have been brought up always with people who
shuddered at the very mention of the word
both here and abroad, and I daresay that I have
a wrong impression about it all. For one thing
I thought it was only poor people who were
Socialists.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;True Socialism is the most fascinating of all
doctrines for the rich and the poor, for all
thoughtful men and women,&#8221; she said, quietly.
&#8220;It is a religion as well as the very core of
politics. But we will not talk about that now.
Are you interested in the new books? You
might like to see some of these.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pointed at the box. &#8220;I get all the new
novels, but I read very few of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked them over as she handed the volumes
out to me. I had read a good many
books in which she was interested. We began
to discuss them, casually at first, and then eag<a class="page" name="Page_43" id="Page_43" title="43"></a>erly.
An hour or more must have slipped away.
At last I looked at the clock and sprang up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have some tea,&#8221; she said, with
her hand on the bell. &#8220;Please do not hurry
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated, but she seemed to take my consent
for granted, and I suffered myself to be
persuaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see my den while they bring it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened a door on the left hand of the
hall, and I passed by her side into a large room
of irregular shape, from which French windows
led out on to the trim little lawn. The walls
were almost lined with books&mdash;my father&#8217;s library
did not hold so many. A writing table
drawn up to the window was covered with loose
sheets of paper and works of reference turned
upon their faces. For the rest the room was a
marvel of delicate coloring and refined femininity.
There were plenty of cosy chairs, and
three-legged tables, with their burden of dainty
china, rare statuettes, and many vases of flowers,
mostly clustering yellow roses. But what
absorbed my attention after my rapid glance
around was the fact that Mr. Bruce Deville
was sitting in a very comfortable chair near the
window, reading one of the loose sheets of
paper which he had taken from the desk.</p>

<p>He rose from his feet at the sound of the
opening of the door, but he did not immedi<a class="page" name="Page_44" id="Page_44" title="44"></a>ately
look up. He spoke to her, and I scarcely
recognized his voice. His gruffness was gone!
It was mellow and good-humored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcia! Marcia! Why can&#8217;t you leave poor
Harris alone?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will drive him
out of his senses if you sling Greek at him like
this. You women are so vindictive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will condescend to turn round,&#8221; she
answered, smiling, &#8220;I shall be glad to know
how you got in here, and what are you doing
with my manuscript?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up, and the sheet fluttered from
his fingers. He regarded me with undiluted
astonishment. &#8220;Well, I came in at the window,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;I was in a hurry to escape
getting wet through. I had no idea that you
had a visitor!&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced towards her. She was in no way
discomposed or annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not inclined to walk this afternoon,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Will you come down after dinner,
about nine? I want to see you, but not just
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, and took up his cap. At the
window he looked back at me curiously. For
a moment he seemed about to speak. He contented
himself, however, with a parting bow, to
which I responded. Directly he got outside
the garden he took his pipe from his pocket and
lit it.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="45"></a></p>

<p>The incident did not seem to have troubled
her in any way. She pointed out some of the
treasures of her room, elegant little trifles, collected
in many countries of the world, but I am
afraid I was not very attentive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Deville a relation of yours?&#8221; I asked,
rather abruptly.</p>

<p>She had just taken down a little Italian statuette
for my inspection, and she replaced it
carefully before she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We are friends. I have known him
for a good many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tiny Burmese gong rang out from the hall.
She came across the room towards me, smiling
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go and have some tea? I always
want tea so much after a thunderstorm. I will
show you some more of my Penates, if you like
afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed her into the hall, and took my tea
from the hands of a prim little maid servant.
With the Dresden cup between my fingers a
sudden thought flashed into my mind. If only
Lady Naselton could see me. Unconsciously
my lips parted, and I laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do forgive me,&#8221; I begged. &#8220;Something
came into my mind. It was too funny. I could
not help laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be able to laugh at one&#8217;s thoughts is a
luxury,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I know a man who<a class="page" name="Page_46" id="Page_46" title="46"></a>
lived through a terrible illness solely because of
his sense of humor. There are so many things
to laugh at in the world, if only one sees them
in the right light. Let me give you some more
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>I set down my cup. &#8220;No more, thanks. That
has been delicious. I wonder whether I might
ask you a question?&#8221; I added. &#8220;I should like
to if I might.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly may,&#8221; she answered,
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville spoke of your work,&#8221; I continued;
&#8220;and of course I could see you had
been writing. Do you write fiction? I think
it is so delightful for women to do anything for
themselves&mdash;any real work, I mean. Do you
mind my asking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not write fiction as a rule,&#8221; she said,
slowly. &#8220;I write for the newspapers. I was a
correspondent for several years for one of the
dailies. I write more now for a purpose. I am
one of the &#8216;abhorred tribe,&#8217; you know&mdash;a Socialist,
or what people understand as a Socialist.
Are you horrified?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; I answered her; &#8220;only I
should like to know more about it. From what
I have heard about Socialism I should never
have dreamed of associating it with&mdash;well, with
Dresden cups and saucers, for instance,&#8221; I
laughed, motioning to her own.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" title="47"></a></p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled. &#8220;Poor child,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you have all the old-fashioned ideas about us
and our beliefs, I suppose. I am not sure that,
if you were a properly regulated young lady,
you would not get up and walk out of the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow had fallen across the open doorway,
and a familiar voice, stern, but tremulous
with passion, took up her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is precisely what my daughter will do,
madam! At once, and without delay! Do you
hear, Kate?&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose to my feet dumb with amazement. My
father&#8217;s tall figure, drawn to its utmost height,
stood out with almost startling vividness against
the sunlit space beyond. A deep red flush was
on his pale cheeks. His eyes seemed on fire
with anger. My hostess rose to her feet with
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daughter is at liberty to remain or go
at any time,&#8221; she said, coolly. &#8220;I presume that
I am addressing Mr. Ffolliot?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked over my shoulder towards my
father, and their eyes met. I looked from one
to the other, conscious that something was
passing outside my knowledge&mdash;something between
those two. Her eyes had become like
dull stones. Her face had grown strangely hard
and cold. There was a brief period of intense
silence, broken only by a slow, monotonous<a class="page" name="Page_48" id="Page_48" title="48"></a>
ticking of the hall clock and the flutter of the
birds&#8217; wings from amongst the elm trees outside.
A breath of wind brought a shower of
rain drops down on to the gravel path. A
sparrow flew twittering into the hall and out
again. Then it came to an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcia!&#8221;</p>

<p>His single cry rang out like a pistol shot upon
the intense silence. He took a quick step across
the threshold. She held out both her hands in
front of her, and he stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You had
better go quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went out and took my father&#8217;s arm. He let
me lead him away without a word; but he would
have fallen several times if it had not been for
my support. When we reached home he turned
at once into the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, Kate,&#8221; he said, wearily. &#8220;I must
be alone. See that I am not disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated, but he insisted. I shut the door
and left him. I, too, wanted to be alone. My
brain was in a whirl. What was this past whose
ghosts seemed rising up one by one to confront
us? First there had been Mr. Deville, and now
the woman whom my father had called Marcia.
What were they to him? What had he to do
with them? Where had their lives touched?
I pressed my hot forehead against the window-pane,
and looked across at the Yellow House.<a class="page" name="Page_49" id="Page_49" title="49"></a>
The sunlight was flashing and glistening upon
its damp, rain-soaked front. In the doorway
a woman was standing, shading her eyes with
her hand, and looking across the park. I followed
her gaze, and saw for whom she was
waiting. Bruce Deville was walking swiftly towards
her. I saw him leap a fence to save a
few yards, and he was taking huge and rapid
strides. I turned away from my window and
hid my face in my hands.</p>

<hr class="section" />
<div class="section-break"></div>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_50" id="Page_50" title="50"></a></p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="chap">A SOUTH AMERICAN LETTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Naturally</span> I expected that some time that
night my father would have spoken to me concerning
the strange meeting at the house of the
woman whom he had called Marcia. In a sense
I feared what he might have to say. Already
I was beginning to reckon those few hours as
an epoch in my life. Never had I met any one
whom in so short a time had attracted me so
much. I found myself thinking of her continually,
and the more I thought the more I scoffed
at the idea of connecting in any way with her
those things at which Lady Naselton had
hinted. There seemed something almost
grossly incongruous in any such idea. The
more I thought of her the more resolute I became
in putting all such thoughts behind me.
And, apart from my judgment, which was altogether
on her side, I was conscious of a vague
personal attraction, almost a fascination, which
had a wonderful effect on me. The manner of
her life, her surroundings, that air of quiet, forcible
elegance, which seemed to assert itself<a class="page" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" title="51"></a>
alike in her house, her dress, and her conversation,
were a revelation to me. She was original
too, obviously intellectual, a woman who
held her life well within control, and lived it
fearlessly and self-reliantly. I had never met
any one like it before, and I longed to see more
of her. My one fear was lest my father should
lay some stern embargo upon my association
with her. In that case I had made up my mind
not to yield without a struggle. I would be
quite sure that it was not a matter of merely
prejudice before I consented to give up what
promised to be the most delightful friendship I
had ever known.</p>

<p>But, rather to my surprise, and a little to my
relief, my father ignored our afternoon&#8217;s adventure
when I saw him again. He came in to dinner
as usual, carefully dressed, and ate and
drank with his customary fine care that everything
of which he partook should be of the best
of its kind. After he had left the table we saw
no more of him. He went straight to his study,
and I heard the door shut and the key turned&mdash;a
sign that he was on no account to be disturbed;
and though I sat in the drawing room
until long after my usual time for retiring, and
afterwards remained in my room till the small
hours commenced to chime, his door remained
locked. Yet in the morning he was down before
us. He was standing at the window when<a class="page" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" title="52"></a>
I came into the breakfast room, and the clear
morning light fell mercilessly on his white face,
pallid and lined with the marks of his long vigil.
It seemed to me that he greeted us both more
quietly than usual.</p>

<p>During breakfast time I made a few remarks
to him, but they passed unnoticed, or elicited
only a monosyllabic reply. Alice spoke of the
schools, but he seemed scarcely to hear. We
all became silent. As we were on the point of
rising, the unusual sound of wheels outside attracted
our attention. A fly was passing slowly
along the road beyond our hedge. I caught a
glimpse of a woman&#8217;s face inside, and half rose
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going away!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>My father, too, had half risen. He made a
movement as though to hurry from the room,
but with an effort he restrained himself. The
effect of her appearance upon him was very
evident to me. His under lip was twitching,
and his long, white fingers were nervously interlaced.
Alice, bland and unseeing, glanced
carelessly out of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our mysterious neighbor from the Yellow
House,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;If a tithe of what
people say about her is true we ought to rejoice
that she is going away. It is a pity she is not
leaving for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father opened his lips as though about to<a class="page" name="Page_53" id="Page_53" title="53"></a>
speak. He changed his mind, however, and left
the room. The burden of her defence remained
with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you I would not take any notice
of what people say about her,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;In
all probability you will only hear a pack of lies.
I had tea with her yesterday afternoon, and she
seemed to me to be a very well-bred and distinguished
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked at me with wide-open eyes, and
an expression almost of horror in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you have been to
see her, that you have been inside her house,
Kate?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was caught in the rain and she asked me
in,&#8221; I explained, coolly. &#8220;Afterwards I liked
her so much that I was glad to stay to tea when
she asked me. She is a very charming woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked at me blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Kate, didn&#8217;t Lady Naselton tell you
about her? Surely you have heard what people
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Naselton told me a good many
things,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but I do not make a point
of believing everything disagreeable which I
hear about people. Do you think that charitable
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>My sister&#8217;s face hardened. She had all the<a class="page" name="Page_54" id="Page_54" title="54"></a>
prejudices of her type, in her case developed
before their time. She was the vicar&#8217;s daughter,
in whose eyes the very breath of scandal
was like a devastating wind. Her point of view,
and consequently her judgment, seemed to me
alike narrow and cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget your position,&#8221; she said, with
cold indignation. &#8220;There are other reports of
that woman besides Lady Naselton&#8217;s. Depend
upon it there is no smoke without fire. It is
most indiscreet of you to have had any communication
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; I declared, &#8220;is a matter of opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that she is not a nice woman,&#8221;
Alice said, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall believe her to be a very nice one
until I know the contrary,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I
know her and you do not, and I can assure you
that she is much more interesting than any of
the women who have called upon us round
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice was getting angry with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You prefer an interesting woman to a good
one,&#8221; she said, warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without going quite so far as that, I certainly
think that it is unfortunate that most of
the good women whom one meets are so uninteresting,&#8221;
I answered. &#8220;Goodness seems so
satisfying&mdash;in the case of repletion. I mean&mdash;it
doesn&#8217;t seem to leave room for anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_55" id="Page_55" title="55"></a></p>

<p>Whereupon Alice left me in despair, and I
found myself face to face with my father. He
looked at me in stern disapproval. There was
a distinctly marked frown on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too fond of those flighty sayings,
Kate,&#8221; he remarked, sternly. &#8220;Let me hear
less of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply. There were times when I
was almost afraid of my father, when a suppressed
irritation of manner seemed like the
thin veneer beneath which a volcano was trembling.
To-day the signs were there. I made
haste to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letters have just come,&#8221; I said, holding
out a little packet to him. &#8220;There is one for you
from a place I never heard of&mdash;somewhere in
South America, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took them from me and glanced at the
handwriting of the topmost one. Then for a
short space of time I saw another man before
me. The calm strength of his refined, thoughtful
face was transformed. Like a flash the
gleam of a dark passion lit up his brilliant eyes.
His lips quivered, his fingers were clenched together.
For a moment I thought he would
have torn the letter into shreds unopened.
With an evident effort, however, he restrained
himself, and went out of the room bearing the
letter in his hand.</p>

<p>I heard him walking about in his study all the<a class="page" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="56"></a>
morning. At luncheon time he had quite recovered
his composure, but towards its close
he made, for us, a somewhat startling announcement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to London this afternoon,&#8221; he
said, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To London?&#8221; we both echoed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There is a little business there which
requires my personal attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the circumstances Alice was even
more surprised than I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about Mr. Hewitt?&#8221; she reminded
him blandly. &#8220;We were to meet him at the
schools at five o&#8217;clock this afternoon about the
new ventilators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hewitt must be put off until my return,&#8221;
my father answered. &#8220;The schools have
done without them for ten years so they can go
on for another week. Can I trouble you for the
Worcestershire sauce, Kate?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was my father&#8217;s method of closing the
subject. Alice looked at me with perplexed
face, but my thoughts were elsewhere. I was
wondering whether my father would undertake
a commission for me at Debenham and Freebody&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you be going West?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>He looked up at me and hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_57" id="Page_57" title="57"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;My business is in the city,&#8221; he said, coldly.
&#8220;What do you call West?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regent Street,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>He considered a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be near there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If so I will
try to do what you require. Do not be disappointed
if I should happen to forget about it,
though. If it is important you had better send
direct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you called if it wouldn&#8217;t be
bothering you,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;There is some
money to pay, and it would save my getting
postal orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the room to write a note. When I
came back my father had gone into his study.
I followed him there, and, entering the room
without knocking, found him bending over his
desk.</p>

<p>He looked up at me and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he said, sharply.</p>

<p>I explained, and he took the note from me,
listening to the details of my commission, and
making a note in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see to this for you if I can,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I will not promise, because I shall have other
and more important matters to take up my attention.
In the meantime, I should be glad to
be left undisturbed for an hour. I have some
letters to write.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_58" id="Page_58" title="58"></a></p>

<p>I left him at once, and I heard the key turn
in the door after me. At half-past three a fly
arrived from the Junction, and he appeared
upon the step carrying a small black bag in
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be back,&#8221; he said, &#8220;on Friday. Goodbye,
Alice; goodbye, Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p>We kissed him, and he got up in the carriage
and drove off. Alice and I remained upon the
doorstep looking at one another. We both felt
that there was something mysterious about his
sudden departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any idea what it means?&#8221; she
asked me.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not told me anything,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say that he used to go to London
often when you were at Belchester?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and that is one reason why
we left the place. The people did not like it.
He went away very often; and, indeed, old Colonel
Dacre wrote to the Bishop about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a meddlesome old duffer,&#8221; I remarked,
leaning against the door-post with my
face turned towards the Yellow House.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was rather a busybody,&#8221; Alice admitted;
&#8220;but I am not surprised that he wrote to the
Bishop. A good many other people used to<a class="page" name="Page_59" id="Page_59" title="59"></a>
complain about it. You were not in Belchester
very long, so of course you knew nothing about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you mean to say that you have no
idea at all why he went so often? You don&#8217;t
know what he did there, or anything, not even
where he stayed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the shred of an idea,&#8221; Alice declared.
&#8220;It used to worry me a great deal, and when I
came here I hoped it was all over. Now it
seems as though it were all beginning again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that I know what took
him up to London to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; Alice cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One that he had this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morris gave me the letters through the window,&#8221;
I answered. &#8220;There were only two for
father. One was from Mr. Hewitt&mdash;that was
about the schools you know, and the other was
from somewhere in South America. It was that
letter which took him to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with knitted brows, and a
general expression of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;From South America! I never heard father
speak of any one there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From South America,&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;It was<a class="page" name="Page_60" id="Page_60" title="60"></a>
a large square envelope, and the writing was
very fine and delicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Alice suggested, thoughtfully,
&#8220;whether we have any relatives out there of
whom we do not know. It may be that. Perhaps
they are poor, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I interrupted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter was not from a poor person,&#8221; I
declared, confidently. &#8220;The notepaper, or
rather the envelope, was expensive, and in very
good style. I believe there was a crest on the
envelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; Alice remarked, &#8220;we cannot be certain&mdash;especially
if the letter was from South
America&mdash;that it was the cause of his going to
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we can,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;In one corner
there were three words, written very small&mdash;&#8220;London
about fifteenth.&#8221;</p>

<p>We exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day is the fifteenth,&#8221; Alice remarked.</p>

<p>I nodded. It was true. My sister&#8217;s eyes
were full of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said, softly, &#8220;what will be the
end of it all? Sometimes I am almost afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I, who knew more than she did, was also
troubled. Already I was growing to fear my
father. Always he seemed to move amongst us
with an air of stern repression, as though he
were indeed playing a part, wearing always a<a class="page" name="Page_61" id="Page_61" title="61"></a>
mask, and as though his real life lay somewhere
else, somewhere in the past, or&mdash;worst still&mdash;somewhere
in the present, far away from our
quiet little village. I thought of all the stories
I had read of men who had lived double lives&mdash;men
with a double personality one side of whose
life and actions must necessarily be a wholesale
lie. The fear of something of this sort in connection
with my father was gradually laying
chill hold upon me. He fulfilled his small parish
obligations, and carried himself through the
little routine of our domestic life with a stern
air of thoughtful abstraction, as though he were
performing in a mechanical manner duties contemptible,
trivial, and uninteresting, for some
secret and hidden reason. Was there another
life? My own eyes had shown me that there
was another man. Twice had I seen this mask
raised; first when he had come face to face with
Bruce Deville, and again when he had found
me talking with our curious neighbor beneath
the roof of the Yellow House. Another man
had leaped out then. Who was he? What was
he? Did he exist solely in the past, or was
there a present&mdash;worse still, a future&mdash;to be
developed?</p>

<p>We were standing side by side at the window.
Suddenly there was a diversion. Our
gate was flung open. A tall figure came up<a class="page" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="62"></a>
the drive towards the house. Alice watched
it with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a visitor,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;We had
better go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recognized him, and I remained where I
was. After that little scene upon the lawn only
last Sunday I certainly had not expected to see
Mr. Bruce Deville again within the confines of
our little demesne. Yet there he was, walking
swiftly up the gravel walk&mdash;tall, untidy, and
with that habitual contraction of the thick eyebrows
which was almost a scowl. I stepped out
to meet him, leaving Alice at the window. He
regarded us coldly, and raised his cap with the
stiffest and most ungracious of salutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Ffolliot in?&#8221; he asked me. &#8220;I should
like to have a word with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ignored his question for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said, quietly.</p>

<p>His color rose a little. He was not so insensible
as he tried to appear, but his bow was
flagrantly ironical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221; he answered,
frigidly. &#8220;I should like a word with your
father&mdash;if I could trouble you so far as to tell
him that I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father will be exceedingly sorry to have
missed you,&#8221; I answered, smiling upon him;
&#8220;he is out just now.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" title="63"></a></p>

<p>His frown deepened, and he was obviously
annoyed. He made ready to depart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me when he will be in?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I will call again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that I cannot positively,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;We expect him home on Friday, but
I don&#8217;t know at what time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned round upon me with a sudden
change on his face. His curiously colored eyes
seemed to have caught fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that he has gone away?&#8221; he
asked, brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone to London this afternoon,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;Can I give him any message from
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood quite still, and seemed to be looking
me through and through. Then he drew a
small time-table from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Annesly Junction, 3.30; St. Pancras, 7.50,&#8221;
he muttered to himself. &#8220;Thank you; good
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned upon his heel, but I called him
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked round. &#8220;I beg
your pardon,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I should be
sorry to detain you. You dropped something
when you took out your time-table, and it oc<a class="page" name="Page_64" id="Page_64" title="64"></a>curred
to me that you might want it again.
That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came back with three great strides. A
square envelope, to which I was pointing, lay
on the ground almost at my feet. As he
stooped to pick it up I too glanced at it for the
second time. A little exclamation escaped
from my lips. He looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning Mr. Deville.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. He was evidently
desirous of knowing why I had uttered that exclamation.
I did not choose to satisfy him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you made some remark,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;You are in
a hurry, I think you said. Don&#8217;t let me keep
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pocketed the envelope and strode away.
Alice came out of the low window to me, looking
after him with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary man!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>But I did not answer her immediately, I had
found something else to think about. There
was no possibility of any mistake. The handwriting
upon the envelope which Mr. Deville
had dropped was the same as that which had
summoned my father to London.</p>

<span class="chap">THE MILLIONAIRE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Thursday following my father&#8217;s departure
for London Lady Naselton sent her carriage
for me, and a note marked urgent. It
contained only a few lines, evidently written in
a hurry.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="date">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Naselton</span>, <i>Thursday</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Girl</span>,&mdash;Put on your calling-frock,
and come up to tea at once. The Romneys and
a few other people are coming over, and Fred
brought a most interesting man down from
town this morning. I want you to know him.
He is quite delightful to talk to, and is a millionaire!
Come and help me entertain him.</p>

<p class="signature">
&#8220;Yours ever,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Amy Naselton</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I laughed as I went upstairs to change my
things. Lady Naselton was famed throughout
the county as an inveterate matchmaker. Without
a doubt the millionaire who was delightful
to talk to was already in her mind as the most<a class="page" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" title="66"></a>
suitable match for a poor country clergyman&#8217;s
daughter who had the misfortune to possess
ambitions. I could tell by the fussy manner
in which she greeted me that she considered
the matter already almost settled. The room
was full of people, but my particular victim was
sitting alone in a recess. Evidently he had been
kept back for my behoof. Lady Naselton, as
though suddenly remembering his presence,
brought him over and introduced him at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Berdenstein,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;Miss Ffolliot.
Will you see that Miss Ffolliot has some tea?&#8221;
she added, smiling upon him blandly. &#8220;My servants
all seem so stupid to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat down and looked at him while he attended
to my wants. At the first glance I disliked
him. He was tall and dark, with sallow
face and regular features of somewhat Jewish
type. There was too much unction about his
manner. He smiled continually, and showed
his teeth too often. I found myself wondering
whether he had made his million in a shop. I
was forced to talk to him, however, and I settled
myself down to be bored.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been in England long?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;About three days,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>His voice was not so bad. I looked at him
again. His face was not a pleasant one, and he
seemed to be scarcely at his ease, added to<a class="page" name="Page_67" id="Page_67" title="67"></a>
which something in his bearing indistinctly
suggested a limited acquaintance with drawing
rooms such as Lady Naselton&#8217;s. Yet it was
possible that he was clever. His forehead was
well shaped, and his mouth determined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fred Naselton was the first man I saw
in London,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;It was a very odd
thing to run against him before I was well off
the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was an old friend of yours?&#8221; I continued,
purely for the sake of keeping up the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very. Oh, no! Scarcely friend at all,&#8221;
he disclaimed. &#8220;I did him a turn in Rio last
month. Nothing to speak of, but he was grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rio,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Rio Janeiro&mdash;you
know, capital of South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned and faced him suddenly. His eyes
had been fixed on my face. He had been
watching me furtively. My heart beat suddenly
faster. I drew a little breath, I could not trust
myself to speak for a moment. After a brief
pause he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been out there a good many years.
Long enough to get jolly well sick of the place
and people and everything connected with it.
I&#8217;m thankful to say that I&#8217;ve finished with it.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_68" id="Page_68" title="68"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going back, then,&#8221; I remarked,
indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I only went to make
money, and I&#8217;ve made it&mdash;a good deal. Now
I&#8217;m going to enjoy it, here, in the old country.
Marry and settle down, and all that sort of
thing, you know, Miss Ffolliot.&#8221;</p>

<p>His keen, black eyes were fixed upon my
face. I felt a slight flush of color in my cheeks.
At that moment I hated Lady Naselton. She
had been talking to this odious man about me,
and he had been quick enough to understand
her aright. I should have liked to have got up
but for a certain reason. He had come from
South America. He had arrived in London
about the 15th. So I sat there and suffered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A most praiseworthy ambition,&#8221; I remarked,
with a sarcasm which I strove vainly to keep to
myself. &#8220;I am sure I wish you every success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very good of you,&#8221; he answered,
slowly. &#8220;Wishes count for a good deal sometimes.
I am very thankful for yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wishes cost little,&#8221; I answered, coldly, &#8220;and
I am afraid that mine are practically valueless.
Have you been away from England long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For many years,&#8221; he answered, after a
slight hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems odd,&#8221; I remarked, &#8220;that your first
visit should be at the house of a comparative<a class="page" name="Page_69" id="Page_69" title="69"></a>
stranger. Have you no relations or old friends
to welcome you back?&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight and peculiar smile hovered upon his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some old friends,&#8221; he said, quietly;
&#8220;I do not know whether they will welcome me
home again. Soon I shall know. I am not far
away from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they know of your return?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them. One of them I should say,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;The one about whom I care
does not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to surprise him?&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to surprise her,&#8221; he corrected.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. I had no more
doubt in my mind. Chance had brought me
face to face with the writer of that letter to my
father, the man to find whom he was even now
in London. Perhaps they had already met; I
stole a glance at him; he was furtively watching
me all the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have also,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a sister of whom I
am very fond. She lives in Paris. I have written
to her to come to me&mdash;not here, of course,
to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned a little in my chair and faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; I said, &#8220;if amongst those friends
of whom you speak there is any one whom I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_70" id="Page_70" title="70"></a></p>

<p>His lips parted, and he showed all his glistening
white teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; he said, softly, under his breath,
&#8220;I thought you knew. Has your father sent you
here? Have you any message for me? If so,
let me have it, we may be disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is in London,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;He
left the morning he had your letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is he coming back?&#8221; he asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Friday, I believe,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I am
not quite sure. At any rate, he will be here by
Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>An odd look flashed for a moment across the
man&#8217;s face. It gave me an uneasy sensation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him in London?&#8221; I asked,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I have seen
no one. I have only been in England for a
day or two. I shall look forward,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;to the pleasure of seeing your father on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Bruce Deville?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously. He was wondering
how much I knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bruce Deville?&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;I
have not seen him lately; they tell me he has
altered a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_71" id="Page_71" title="71"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I have only known him a week, and so I
cannot tell,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>Again he fixed his little dark eyes upon me;
he was evidently completely puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have only known him a week, and yet
you know that&mdash;that he and I are not strangers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned it by accident,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>Obviously he did not believe me; he hesitated
for a moment to put his disbelief into words,
and in the meantime I made a bold stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Adelaide Fortress yet?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>His face changed. He looked at me half in
wonder, half eagerly; his whole expression had
softened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am waiting to know
where she is; I would go to her to-day&mdash;if only
I dared&mdash;if only I dared!&#8221;</p>

<p>His dark eyes were lit with passion; a pale
shade seemed to have crept in upon the sallowness
of his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you talk of her,&#8221; he said, speaking
rapidly, and with his voice thick with some
manner of agitation, &#8220;you make me forget everything!
You make me forget who you are,
who she is, where we are! I remember only
that she exists! Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>I laid my hand upon his coat sleeve.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_72" id="Page_72" title="72"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;People will notice
you; speak lower.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice sank; it was still, however, hoarse
with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall know soon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;very soon,
whether the years have made her any kinder;
whether the dream, the wild dream of my life,
is any nearer completion. Oh, you may start!&#8221;
he added, looking into my white, puzzled face;
&#8220;you and your father, and Deville, and the
whole world may know it. I love her still! I
am going to regain her or die! There! You
see it is to be no secret war; go and tell your
father if you like, tell them all, bid them prepare.
If they stand in my way they must suffer.
Soon I am going to her. I am going to
stand before her and point to my grey hairs,
and say, &#8216;Every one of them is a thought of
you; every day of my life has been moulded towards
the winning of you.&#8217; And when I tell
her that, and point to the past, she will be mine
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very sure of her,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>His face fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! no,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I cannot say that; only
it is my hope and my passion which are so
strong. They run away with me; I picture it to
myself&mdash;this blessed thing&mdash;and I forget. Listen!&#8221;
he added, with sudden emphasis, &#8220;you
must promise me something. I have let my<a class="page" name="Page_73" id="Page_73" title="73"></a>
tongue go too fast. I have talked to you as my
other self; you must promise me one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must promise me that you will not
speak of my presence here to her. In a day
or two&mdash;well, we shall see. I shall go to her
then; I shall risk everything. But at present,
no! She must be ignorant of my return until
I myself declare it. You will promise me this?&#8221;</p>

<p>I promised. I scarcely dared do otherwise if
I wished to avoid a scene, for already the agitation
and occasional excitement of his speech
were attracting attention. But, having promised,
I asked him a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not Mr. Deville tell her&mdash;or my
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just possible that Mr. Deville might,&#8221;
he said, with the air of one who had well considered
the matter. &#8220;But I do not think it
likely; there are certain reasons which would
probably keep him silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my father?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>Again there was an odd look in his face.
Somehow it filled me with vague alarm; I could
not imagine what it meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that your
father will tell her; I am nearly sure that he
will not. No, I myself shall announce my return.
I shall stand face to face with her before
she has learned to school her countenance. I<a class="page" name="Page_74" id="Page_74" title="74"></a>
shall see in the light or in the darkness how she
holds me. It will be a test&mdash;a glorious test.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton came rustling up to us with
beaming face. &#8220;My dear girl,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am
so sorry to disturb you, you both look so interested.
Whatever you have found to talk
about I can&#8217;t imagine. Lady Romney is going;
she would so like to know you. Would you
mind coming to speak to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; I declared, rising at once to
my feet; &#8220;I must be going too. Good afternoon,
Mr. Berdenstein.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, but I had no intention
of shaking hands with him. I bowed coldly,
and turned to follow Lady Naselton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is best,&#8221; he murmured, leaning
a little forward. &#8220;We cannot possibly be
friends; no doubt you hate me; we are on opposite
sides. Good afternoon, Miss Ffolliot.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed Lady Naselton, but before we had
reached the Romneys I stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Naselton, who is that man?&#8221; I asked
her. &#8220;What do you know of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;from the
confidential manner in which you have been
talking all this time, I should have imagined
that he had told you his history from childhood.
Frankly, I don&#8217;t know anything about
him at all. He was very good to Fred in South
America, and he has made a lot of money, that<a class="page" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" title="75"></a>
is really all I know. Fred met him in town, and
brought him down without notice. I hope,&#8221;
she added, looking at my pale face, &#8220;that he
has been behaving himself properly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no fault to find with him,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I was curious, that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad, dear,&#8221; she answered, smiling.
&#8220;For a millionaire you know, I don&#8217;t consider
him at all unpresentable, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled faintly. Poor Lady Naselton!</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not strike me as being remarkably
objectionable,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;He is a little awkward,
and very confidential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Naselton piloted me across the room
towards the Romneys, with her arm linked in
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make a few allowances, my dear,&#8221;
she whispered, confidentially. &#8220;One cannot
have everything nowadays. He is really not so
bad, and the money is quite safe. In diamonds,
or something, Fred says. It is quite a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced back to him as I stood talking with
the Romneys. He was sitting quietly where
I had left him, watching me covertly. His
black eyebrows were drawn together, and a
certain look of anxiety seemed to have sharpened
his sallow features. His eyes fell at once
before mine. I felt that I would have given
everything I possessed in the world to have
known who he was.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="chap">A FRUITLESS APPEAL</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Friday</span> passed without any sign of my
father&#8217;s return, and when on Saturday morning
we found no letter from him upon the breakfast
table, the vague disquiet of the day before
assumed a definite shape. We looked into one
another&#8217;s faces, and we were seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be sure to hear from him in an
hour or two,&#8221; Alice said, holding her cup to
her lips with shaking hands. &#8220;He must have
missed the post. We shall have a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; I answered, fervently. &#8220;Nothing
can have happened to him, of course. It is
absurd to feel nervous. But it is too bad of
him. He ought to have written. However
busy he is, he could have found a minute or
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never let him go away again without
leaving us an address of some sort,&#8221; Alice declared.
&#8220;No doubt he will telegraph soon.
Still, one cannot help feeling uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no telegram arrived. Luncheon time
came and passed without a word. The after<a class="page" name="Page_77" id="Page_77" title="77"></a>noon
dragged on. The last train from London
was due at the nearest railway station&mdash;three
miles away&mdash;at six o&#8217;clock. At eight o&#8217;clock
he had not returned. More than an hour ago a
fly with luggage from the train had passed our
gate and gone on to the Yellow House. Alice
was as white as a sheet, and commenced to cry
softly to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a service to-morrow morning, and
no one to help,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;He must be
very ill. What had we better do, Kate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Do! How was I to know? Action of any
sort would have been a relief, but it was like
groping in the dark. He had left no address
to which we could write, and, so far as we knew,
he did not belong to any club nor had he any
friends in London. There was no means of
tracing him, not a clue as to the nature of the
business which had called him so suddenly to
town. Even granting that he had gone to see
Mr. Berdenstein, to meet him on his arrival in
London, it was hopeless to try and imagine
where he might be prosecuting his search. Mr.
Berdenstein had denied that he had met him.
Without a doubt he would deny it again if I
went to him. As he had told me plainly that
we were on opposite sides, to look for help from
him was utterly futile. We girls were helpless.
Alice, whose instincts were largely conventional,
was feeling chiefly the scandal which<a class="page" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>
must accrue when his place in the pulpit to-morrow
remained empty and service had to be
abandoned. For my part, my anxieties were
deeper. Chance had placed in my hands the
threads of a mystery whose unravelment was
threatened with terrible possibilities. I could
not tell what the end of it might be. I scarcely
dared to let my mind dwell upon it at all. I
concentrated my thoughts upon the present dilemma.
The first thing to be done was to find
my father. There was only one possible
shadow of a clue as to his whereabouts. One
man knew the secret of that letter which had
called him up to London. To this man I resolved
that I would go.</p>

<p>But as dusk came on, and I was preparing to
start for the Court, I saw his tall figure crossing
the park towards the Yellow House. I did
not hesitate then any more. To see him there
would be easier than to confront him alone at
the Court. I threw a cloak over my shoulders
and went bareheaded down the drive. The
thing which I was proposing to myself to do
was simple enough in effect, although with my
overwrought nerves it presented itself to me
at the time as a somewhat formidable undertaking.
I was going to confront them together.
I was going to pray for their help.</p>

<p>I walked swiftly across the park and through
the plantation to the Yellow House, and after<a class="page" name="Page_79" id="Page_79" title="79"></a>
pausing for a moment to regain my breath, I
rang the bell. There was no immediate answer,
and save that I could see through a chink in
the drawn curtains a rose-shaded lamp burning
in the drawing room, I should have feared that
after all Adelaide Fortress had not returned.
But in a few minutes the trim little maid-servant
opened the door, letting out a flood of
light. She started with surprise to see me
standing there, looking no doubt a little ghost-like
with my white, anxious face and uncovered
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Mrs. Fortress,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Is she in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, but I took her assent for
granted, and stepped into the hall. She moved
towards the drawing room door. I kept close
by her side, and when she opened it I crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Bruce Deville was there, sitting in a low
chair. To my surprise he was wearing evening
dress, and he had a book in his hand, from
which he appeared to have been reading aloud.
At my entrance he rose to his feet at once with
a little exclamation of surprise. Adelaide Fortress,
whose back had been turned to the door,
turned sharply round. She too rose to her
feet. A swift look passed between them, which
did not escape me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ffolliot!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why, is<a class="page" name="Page_80" id="Page_80" title="80"></a>
anything the matter?&#8221; The little maid had retreated,
and closed the door. I advanced a few
steps further into the room. Somehow I became
dimly conscious that their attitude towards
me, or my mission, if they had surmised
its purport, was in a certain sense hostile. I
looked into the woman&#8217;s eyes, and I was perplexed.
Something had come between us. Perhaps
it was my father&#8217;s stern words to her, perhaps
it was some shadow from those former
days concerning which they certainly had some
common knowledge. But from whatever cause
it arose there was certainly a change. The
frank sympathy which seemed to have sprung
up between us on that delightful afternoon was
altogether a thing of the past, almost as though
it had never been. She faced me coldly, with
indrawn lips and unfriendly face. I was confused
and perplexed; yet even in that same moment
a thought flashed in upon me. She was
wearing a mask. For some reason or other
she was putting away her friendliness. Surely
it was the memory of my father&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Mr. Deville I wanted to see,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I saw him cross the park on his way here, so
I followed. I am in trouble. I wanted to ask
him a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood leaning against the broad mantelpiece,
his brows contracted, his face cold and
forbidding.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_81" id="Page_81" title="81"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that I cannot help you, Miss
Ffolliot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot conceive any way
in which I could be of service to you, I am
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can help me if you will, by answering
a single question,&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;You
dropped a letter from your pocket on Wednesday
morning, and I returned it to you. Tell me
whose handwriting it was!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little crash upon the floor, and
the sound of a half-uttered exclamation. Adelaide
Fortress had dropped a small china ornament
with which she had been playing. She
did not even glance towards the pieces at her
feet. She was bending slightly towards me, her
lips half parted, her cheeks pale. Her appearance
fascinated me; I forgot Mr. Deville altogether
until the sound of his clear, deep voice
broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had several letters in my pocket, Miss
Ffolliot,&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;I am not sure that
I remember which one it was that you were
good enough to restore to me. In any case,
how are you interested in the writer of any of
them? What has it to do with your present
trouble&mdash;whatever that may be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; I answered, readily. &#8220;On
Tuesday morning my father received a letter,
and whatever its contents were, they summoned
him to London. He was to have returned yes<a class="page" name="Page_82" id="Page_82" title="82"></a>terday.
He did not come, and he sent no message.
All to-day we have had no word from
him. The last train from London to-night is
in, and he has not come. We do not know
where he is, or what has become of him. There
are the services to-morrow, and no one to take
them. He must be ill, or in trouble of some
sort, or he would have returned, that is certain.
It has made us terribly anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to hear this, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If I could help you I would be glad,
but I am afraid I do not quite see&mdash;exactly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I raised my eyes to his and looked him in
the face. The words seemed to die away upon
his lips. He was not actor enough for his part.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you why I came to you for help,
Mr. Deville,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;The handwriting
upon the letter which you dropped was the
same handwriting which summoned my father
to London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, some glimmering of
the mystery in which these persons and my
father were alike concerned dawned upon me.
The man and the women looked at one another;
Bruce Deville walked over to the window
without answering or addressing me. I
had, indeed, asked no direct question. Yet they
knew what I wanted. It was the whole truth
which I desired.</p>

<p>I stamped my foot upon the floor. Did they<a class="page" name="Page_83" id="Page_83" title="83"></a>
know what my sufferings were, those two persons,
with their pale, puzzled faces and cold
words? I felt myself growing angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Who wrote you
that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still neither the man nor the woman spoke.
Their silence maddened me. I forgot my promise
to the man at Naselton Hall. I forgot everything
except my desire to sting them out of
that merciless, unsympathetic silence. So I
cried out to them&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you who wrote it; it was a man
from South America, and his name is Berdenstein.
He is at Naselton Hall. I will go to
him. Perhaps he will tell me what you will
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stepped forward with outstretched
hand. His face was dark with passionate anger,
almost I thought he would have struck me.
But the woman&#8217;s was pale as death, and a drop
of red blood marked the place where her teeth
met her under lip. Then I saw that the man
had known, but the woman had not.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you know so much,&#8221; he said, brutally,
&#8220;you had better go to him and discover the
rest. You will find him very sympathetic.
Without a doubt he will help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s negative rang out with a sudden
sharp and crisp distinctness. She rose and<a class="page" name="Page_84" id="Page_84" title="84"></a>
came over to my side. She laid her hands softly
upon my shoulders. Her face amazed me, it
was so full of sympathy, and yet so sorrowful.
She, too, had received a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; she said, softly, &#8220;you must not be
impatient. I believe that your father is well. I
believe that somehow or other he will contrive
to be here in time to take up his duties to-morrow.
We could not tell you&mdash;either Mr. Deville
or I&mdash;where he is, but we know perhaps a
little more than you do. He is in London
somewhere seeking for that person whom you
have just mentioned. He will not find him, but
he will not give up searching for him till the
last moment. But, child, whatever you do,
avoid that man Berdenstein like a pestilence.
Your father and he are bitter and terrible enemies.
Do not dream of going to him. Do not
let your father know that he is near. If fate
must have it so, they will meet. But God forbid!&mdash;but
God forbid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he, then, this man, this Berdenstein?&#8221;
I asked her under my breath. Her
words had had a powerful effect upon me. She
was terribly in earnest. I knew that she was
speaking for my good. I trusted her. I could
not help it.</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her eyes were full of
horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for me to tell you, child. It is one<a class="page" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" title="85"></a>
of those things which God forbid that you may
ever know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was a silence between us. After
all this mystery whose shadows seemed to surround
me was like a far away thing. My present
trouble weighed heaviest upon me. The
other was vague, even though it was terrible.
My father&#8217;s disappearance was a real and terrible
calamity staring me in the face. It engrossed
all my thoughts. They would tell me
nothing, those two. I dared not go to Berdenstein.
Already I was afraid of him. I remembered
his smile when I spoke of my father,
and I shuddered. Supposing they had met.
Supposing they had come together face to face
in some lonely house. Perhaps his letter had
been a decoy. The man&#8217;s face, with its cruel
mouth and sardonic smile, suddenly loomed
large in my memory. I sprang to my feet with
a cry of fear. I was terrified with my own
thoughts. Bruce Deville came over to me, and
I found him studying my face with a new expression,
the meaning of which I could not
fathom.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will come to the window, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I think you will see something
which will relieve some part of your anxiety at
any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hastened eagerly to his side. Only a few
yards away, walking steadily in the middle of<a class="page" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" title="86"></a>
the hard, white road, was a figure in sombre
black. His shoulders were bent, and his pale
face downcast. His whole appearance was that
of a weary and dejected wanderer. These
things I realized more completely afterwards;
for the present a sense of almost intolerable relief
drowned every other motion. It was my
father&mdash;he had returned.</p>

<p>I should have rushed out to him, but Bruce
Deville laid his hand very softly upon my
shoulder. I could not have believed that any
touch of his could be so gentle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would take my advice, Miss
Ffolliot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take the path through the
plantation home, and don&#8217;t let your father see
you leaving here. It would be better, would it
not, Adelaide?&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>She looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it would be better,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do
you mind? You will be at home as soon as
he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not but admit that the advice was
good, bearing in mind my father&#8217;s words when
he found me there only a few days before. Yet
it galled me that it should have been offered.
What was this secret shared between these
three of which I was ignorant? I declared to
myself that I would know as soon as my father
and I were alone together. I would insist upon
all these things being made clear to me. I<a class="page" name="Page_87" id="Page_87" title="87"></a>
would bear it no longer, I was resolved on that.
But in the meantime I was helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;perhaps you are
right, I will go by the footpath.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the room abruptly. Mr. Deville opened
the front door for me, and hesitated with his
cap in his hand. I waved him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go alone,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It is quite light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; he answered, shortly. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and re-entered the
room. I crossed the road with soft footsteps.
At the opening of the plantation I paused. My
father was in the road below walking wearily
and leaning upon his stick. At my sudden
standstill a twig beneath my feet snapped short.
A sudden change seemed to transform his face.
He stopped short and turned round with the
swift, eager movement of a young man. His
hand fumbled for a moment in the pocket of his
long clerical coat, and reappeared clutching
something which flashed like steel in the dull
light. He held it at arm&#8217;s length, looking eagerly
around, peering forward in my direction,
but unable to see me owing to the dark shadows
of the trees beneath which I stood. But I on
the other hand could see his every movement;
in the half-light his figure stood out in such
marvellous distinctness against the white road
and the low, grey line of sky beyond. I could<a class="page" name="Page_88" id="Page_88" title="88"></a>
see him, and I could see what it was he carried
in his hand. It was a small, shining revolver.</p>

<p>He stood quite still like a man expecting a
sudden attack. When none came and the stillness
remained unbroken, the strained, eager
light died slowly out of his face. He appeared
rather disappointed than relieved. Reluctantly
he turned around, and with the revolver still in
his hand but hidden beneath the skirts of his
coat, made his way up the white hill towards
the Vicarage. He must have walked quickly,
for although I hurried, and my way back was
the shorter, he was already at our gate when I
emerged from the plantation. As he stooped
to adjust the fastening I heard him groan, and
bending forward I caught a glimpse of his face.
I must have cried out, only my lips seemed palsied
as though I were but a sleeping figure in
some terrible nightmare. His face was like the
face of a dead man. He seemed to have aged
by at least a dozen years. As he hastened up
the little drive, his walk, usually so dignified
and elastic, became a shamble. It seemed to
me that this was but the wreck of the man who
had left us only a few days before.</p>

<span class="chap">THE COMING OF MR. BERDENSTEIN</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are days marked in our lives with
white stones. We can never forget them.
Recollections, a very easy effort of memory,
seem to bring back even in some measure the
very thrill, the same pulsations and emotions,
as were kindled into life by certain never-to-be-forgotten
happenings. Time cannot weaken
them. Whilst we have life the memory of them
is eternal. And there are other days against
the memory of which we have dropped a black
stone. We shrink from anything which may
recall them. No sacrifice would seem too great
if only we could set the seal of oblivion upon
those few hated hours. We school ourselves
to close our eyes, and turn our heads away
from anything which might in any manner recall
them to us. Yet we are powerless. Ghosts
of them steal light-footed, detested and uninvited
guests, across our fairest moments; the
chill of winter shakes us on the most brilliant
of midsummer days; the color steals from our
cheeks, and our blood runs to water. We are<a class="page" name="Page_90" id="Page_90" title="90"></a>
at the mercy of those touches of icy reminiscence.
There is no escape from them. There
never will be any escape. The Sunday which
followed my father&#8217;s visit to London is one of
those hideous memories. In the calendar of my
life it is marked with the blackest of black
stones. I only pray that such another day as
that may never find its way into my life.</p>

<p>The morning passed much as usual. My
father had scarcely spoken to us on the previous
evening. In reply to our half eager, half
frightened questions, he admitted that he had
been ill. He would not hear of a doctor. His
malady, he told us, was one which he himself
perfectly understood. He would be better in
a few days. He ate and drank sparingly, and
then retired at once to his room. We heard
him drag himself wearily up the stairs, and
Alice burst into tears, and I myself felt a lump
in my throat. Yet what could we do? He
would not have us near him. The only invalid&#8217;s
privilege which he permitted himself
was a fire in his bedroom, and this he asked for
immediately he entered the house, although the
night was close and oppressive, and he had
come in with beads of perspiration standing out
upon his white forehead.</p>

<p>In the morning he preached an old sermon,
preached it with weary lips and wholly nonchalant
manner. His pallid face and lustreless<a class="page" name="Page_91" id="Page_91" title="91"></a>
eyes became objects of remark amongst the
meagre congregation. I could hear people
whispering to one another when the service was
over. Lady Naselton spoke to me of it with
concern as we passed down the aisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to see your father looking so
dreadfully ill dear,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;I am particularly
sorry to-day. Come outside, and I
will tell you why.&#8221;</p>

<p>We passed out together into the sunlit air,
fresh and vigorous after the dull vault-like
gloom of the little church, with its ivy-hung
windows. Lady Naselton held my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the Bishop is lunching
with us to-day, and staying all night. I
have spoken to him about your father. He remembers
him quite well, and he is coming to
service this evening on purpose to hear him
preach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bishop,&#8221; I repeated, vaguely. &#8220;Do
you mean our Bishop? The Bishop of Exchester?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea. I am not supposed, of course, to say
anything about it, as his visit has nothing
whatever to do with diocesan affairs, but I
should be disappointed if your father did not
make an impression upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked around to be sure that no one
was listening. It was quite a needless precaution.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_92" id="Page_92" title="92"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You see, dear, I happen to know that there
are two vacant stalls at the cathedral, and the
Bishop wants a preacher badly. It is owing
to what I have told him about your father that
he is coming over to-day. I do hope that he
will be at his best this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that there is very little chance
of it,&#8221; I answered, blankly. &#8220;He is really very
ill. He will not admit it, but you can see for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must make an effort,&#8221; Lady Naselton
said, firmly. &#8220;Will you tell him this from me?
Say that we shall all be there, and if only he
can make a good impression&mdash;well, it is the
chance of a lifetime. Of course, we shall all be
terribly sorry to lose you, but Exchester is not
very far off, and we really could not expect to
keep a man with your father&#8217;s gifts very long.
Try and rouse him up, won&#8217;t you? Goodbye,
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drove off, and I waited at the vestry door
for my father. He came out with half-closed
eyes, and seemed scarcely to see me. I walked
by his side, and repeated what Lady Naselton
had told me. Contrary to my expectations, the
news was sufficient to rouse him from his
apathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bishop here to-night!&#8221; he repeated,
thoughtfully. &#8220;You are quite sure that there
is no mistake? It is the Bishop of Exchester?&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_93" id="Page_93" title="93"></a></p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Lady Naselton assured me. I have
heard her say more than once that they knew
him very well indeed. She is most anxious that
you should do your very best. It seems that
there are two stalls vacant at the cathedral.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light flashed into his eyes for a moment,
and then died out.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only it had been a week ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have other things in my mind now. I am not
in the mood to prepare anything worth listening
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those other things, father,&#8221; I said, softly.
&#8220;Are we to remain wholly ignorant of them?
If there is any trouble to be faced, we are ready
to take our share.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head, and a wan smile flickered
for a moment upon his pale lips. He looked
at me not unkindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may come, Kate,&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;Till
then, be patient and ask no questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had reached the house, and I said no
more. Directly after luncheon, at which he ate
scarcely anything, he went into his study. We
hoped, Alice and I, that he had gone to work.
But in less than half an hour he came out. I
met him in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hat and stick, Kate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am
going for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_94" id="Page_94" title="94"></a></p>

<p>His manner forbade questions, but as he was
leaving the house an impulse came to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come with you, father?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I
was going for a walk too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, and seemed
about to refuse. What made him change his
mind I could never tell. But he did change it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can come,&#8221; he said, shortly. &#8220;I
am starting now, though. I cannot wait for a
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite ready,&#8221; I answered, taking my
hat and gloves from the stand. So we passed
out of the house together.</p>

<p>At the gate he paused for a moment, and I
thought that he was going to take the road
which led to the Yellow House and Deville
Court. Apparently he changed his mind, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will take the footpath to Bromilow
Downs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have never been there.&#8221;</p>

<p>We turned our backs upon the more familiar
places, and walked slowly along the country
which led to the Downs. We neither of us
spoke a word for some time. Once or twice I
glanced towards him with concern. He was
moving with uncertain steps, and every now and
then he pressed his hand to his side. Physically,
I could see that he was scarcely equal to
the exertion of walking. It was mental disquiet
which had brought him out. His eyes were dry<a class="page" name="Page_95" id="Page_95" title="95"></a>
and bright, and there was a hectic flush upon
his cheeks. As we passed from the lane out on
to the open Downs, he drew a little breath and
removed his hat. The autumn wind swept
through his hair, and blew open his coat. He
took in a long breath of it. &#8220;This is good,&#8221; he
said, softly. &#8220;Let us rest here.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat upon the trunk of a fallen pine tree
on the verge of the common. Far away on the
hillside rose the red chimneys of Naselton Hall.
I looked at them, and of a sudden the desire to
tell my father what I knew of that man&#8217;s presence
there grew stronger and stronger. After
all it was his right to know. It was best to
tell him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have something to say
to you. It is something which I think you
ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked away from vacancy into my face.
Something in my manner seemed to attract
him. He frowned, and answered me sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, child? Only mind that it is not
a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a question.&#8221; I said. &#8220;It is something
that I want to tell you. Perhaps I ought
to have told you before. One afternoon last
week I was at Lady Naselton&#8217;s for tea. I met
a man there&mdash;half a foreigner he seemed to me.
He had lately returned from South America.
His name was Berdenstein.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_96" id="Page_96" title="96"></a></p>

<p>He heard me in perfect silence. He did not
utter a single exclamation. Only I saw his
head sink, and a curious marble rigidity settle
down upon his features, chasing away all expression.
In the silence which followed before
I spoke again I could hear his breathing sharp
and low, almost like the panting of an animal
in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that I have been spying on you,
father,&#8221; I begged. &#8220;It all came about so naturally.
I gave you your letters the morning
that you went away, and I could not help seeing
that one of them was from South America. On
the envelope was written: &#8216;In London about the
15th.&#8217; Well, as you left for London at once, I
considered that you went to meet that person,
whoever it was. Then at Lady Naselton&#8217;s this
man stared at me so, and he told me that he
came from South America. Some instinct
seemed to suggest to me that this was the man
who had written that letter. I talked to him
for awhile, and I was sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then my father spoke. He was like a man
who had received a stroke. His voice seemed
to come from a great distance. His eyes were
fixed upon that break in the trees on the distant
hillside beyond which was Naselton Hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;So near,&#8221; he said, softly&mdash;&#8220;so very near!
How did he come here? Was it chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was good to Lady Naselton&#8217;s son<a class="page" name="Page_97" id="Page_97" title="97"></a>
abroad,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;He is very rich, they
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay!&#8221; My father nodded his head
slowly. His manner was becoming more natural.
Yet there was a look of deadly earnest in
his white, set face. To look at him made me almost
shudder. Something in his expression
was like a premonition of the tragedy to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet soon, then,&#8221; he said,
thoughtfully. &#8220;It may be to-morrow. It may
be to-day. Kate, your eyes are younger than
mine. Is that a man coming along the road
there?&mdash;down in the hollow on the other side
of the turn. Do you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood up by his side. There was a figure
in sight, but as yet a long way off.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a man,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He is coming towards
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood there side by side for several minutes.
My father was leaning upon my shoulder.
The clutch of his fingers seemed to burn their
way through my dress into my flesh. It was
as though they were tipped with fire. He did
not move or speak. He kept his eyes steadfastly
fixed upon the bend of the road. Suddenly
a slight change flashed into his face. He
leaned forward; his upper lip quivered; he
shaded his eyes with his hand. I followed his
rapt gaze, and in the middle of the dusty white
road I could see the man now. Well within<a class="page" name="Page_98" id="Page_98" title="98"></a>
sight, I watched him draw nearer and nearer.
His carriage was buoyant and un-English, and
he carried a cane, with which he snapped off
the heads of the thistles growing by the hedge-side.
He seemed to be whistling softly to himself,
showing all the while those rows of white,
glistening teeth unpleasantly prominent against
the yellowish tinge of his cheeks. From the
first I had scarcely doubted that this was the
man of whom we had been talking. The coincidence
of his coming never even struck me. It
seemed at the time to be a perfectly natural
thing.</p>

<p>He came to within a yard or two of us before
he appeared to recognize me. Then he
took off his hat and made me a sweeping bow.
In the middle of it he encountered my father&#8217;s
steady gaze. His hat slipped from his fingers&mdash;he
stood like a man turned to stone. His black
eyes were full of horror; he looked at my father
as a man would look at one risen from the dead.
And my father returned his gaze with a faint,
curious smile parting his thin lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to England once more, Stephen,&#8221;
my father said, grimly. &#8220;You were about to
address my daughter. Have you lost your
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man opened his lips twice before he
spoke. I could almost fancy that his teeth were
chattering. His voice was very low and husky.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_99" id="Page_99" title="99"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask the way to Deville
Court,&#8221; he said. All the time his eyes never
left my father&#8217;s face. For some reason or other
they were full of wonder; my father&#8217;s presence
seemed to terrify him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The way to Deville Court?&#8221; my father repeated.
&#8220;I am returning in that direction. I
will show it to you myself. There are several
turns before you get on to the straight road.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father descended the bank into the road.
The stranger muttered something inaudible,
which my father ignored.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better start,&#8221; he said, calmly. &#8220;It
is rather a long way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man whom my father had called Stephen
hesitated and drew back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young lady,&#8221; he suggested, faintly&mdash;&#8220;she
will come with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The young lady has an engagement in another
direction,&#8221; he said, with his eyes fixed on
me. &#8220;I want you, Kate, to call upon Mr.
Charlsworth and tell him to be sure to be at
church to-night. You can tell him why it is
important.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a ring in my father&#8217;s tone, and a
light in the glance which he flashed upon me
which forbade any idea of remonstrance. Yet
at the thought of leaving those two men together
a cold chill seemed to pass through all
my veins. Something seemed to tell me that<a class="page" name="Page_100" id="Page_100" title="100"></a>
this was no ordinary meeting. The man Berdenstein&#8217;s
look of terror as he had recognized
my father was unmistakable. Even now he was
afraid to go with him. Yet I was powerless, I
dared not disobey. Already the two men were
walking side by side. I was left alone, and the
farmhouse to which my father had bidden me
go lay in altogether a different direction. I
stood and watched them pass along the lane together.
Then I went on my errand. There
was nothing else I could do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">I reached home in about an hour. Alice met
me at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has father come in yet?&#8221; I asked her,
quickly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;About five minutes ago. The walk seemed
to have done him good,&#8221; she added. &#8220;He was
quite cheerful, and had a wonderful color. Why,
Kate! what have you been doing to yourself?
You are as white as a ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was alone, I suppose?&#8221; I asked, ignoring
the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone! Of course he was alone. Come in
and have some tea at once. You look tired
out.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="chap">A TERRIBLE INTERRUPTION</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> some means or other the news had spread
in the village, and such a congregation as I
had never seen filled our little church long before
the usual time. In a dark corner I saw, to
my surprise, Bruce Deville leaning against a
pillar with folded arms, and on my way to my
pew I passed Adelaide Fortress seated in a
chair in the nave. Neither of these two had I
ever seen in church before, and what had
brought them there on that particular evening
I never clearly understood. It was a little irony
of fate&mdash;one of those impulses which it is hard
to believe are altogether coincidences.</p>

<p>The Bishop came early, and sat by Lady
Naselton&#8217;s side, the centre of all eyes. I looked
away from him to the chancel. I was strangely
nervous. It was still dimly lit, although the
bells had ceased to ring. There was only a moment&#8217;s
pause, however, then the little space was
filled with white-robed figures, and my sister&#8217;s
voluntary, unduly prolonged in this instance,
died away in a few soft chords. I drew a long<a class="page" name="Page_102" id="Page_102" title="102"></a>
breath of relief. Everything was going as
usual. Perhaps, after all this night might be a
fateful one to us.</p>

<p>I watched the Bishop&#8217;s face from the first. I
saw him glance up as if in surprise at my
father&#8217;s rich, musical voice, which woke the
echoes of the dark little church with the first
words of the service. At the singing, which
was always wretched, he frowned, and, catching
a sideway glance from Lady Naselton, smiled
somewhat. Studying him through half-closed
eyelids, I decided that country services in the
abstract did not attract him, and that he was a
little bored.</p>

<p>It was only when my father stood up in the
pulpit and looked around him in that moment
or two of hushed suspense which precedes the
giving out of the text, that the lines of his face
relaxed, and he settled himself down with an
air of interest.</p>

<p>For me it was a terribly anxious moment. I
knew my father&#8217;s state of health, and I remembered
the few weary and pointless words which
had gone to make his morning sermon. Contrary
to his usual custom, he stood there without
any notes of any sort. I scarcely dared to
hope that he would be able to do himself justice.
Yet the first words of his text had
scarcely left his lips when some premonition of
what was to come sent a strange thrill through<a class="page" name="Page_103" id="Page_103" title="103"></a>
all my nerves. &#8220;The wages of sin is death.&#8221;
No words could give any idea of the marvellous
yet altogether effortless solemnity with which
these words passed from my father&#8217;s lips.
Scarcely uttered above a whisper, they yet penetrated
to the utmost corners of the little church.
Was it really intense earnestness or a wonderful
knowledge and appreciation of true dramatic
effect which made him close the book
with a slow movement of his forefinger, and
stand up there amongst the deep shadows as
pale as the surplice which hung around his pale
form? Yet when he spoke his voice did not
tremble or falter. His words, tense with life,
all vibrating with hidden fire, penetrated easily
to the furthest and darkest corner of the
building.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wages of sin&mdash;the eternal torment of a
conscience never sleeping, never weary!&#8221; It
was of that he went on to speak. I can scarcely
remember so much as a single sentence of that
sermon, although its effect upon myself and
those who formed the congregation of listeners,
is a memory which even now thrills me. From
those few opening words, pregnant as they
were with dramatic force, and lit with the fire
of true eloquence, not for one moment did the
attention of the little congregation wander. A
leaf could have been heard to drop in the
church, the rustle of a pocket handkerchief was<a class="page" name="Page_104" id="Page_104" title="104"></a>
a perfectly audible sound. Not even a child
looked sideways to watch the dark ivy waving
softly against the stained glass windows or wondered
at the strange pattern which a ray of
dying sunlight had traced upon the bare stone
aisles. There was something personal&mdash;something
like the cry of human sorrow itself in
that slow, passionate outpouring. Was it by
any chance a confession or an accusation to
which we were listening? It was on the universality
of sin of which my father spoke with such
heart-moving emphasis. Our lives were like
cupboards having many chambers, some of
which were open indeed to the daylight and the
gaze of all men, but there were others jealously
closed and locked. We could make their outside
beautiful, we could keep the eyes of all
men from penetrating beneath that fair exterior.
We could lock them with a cunning and
secret key, so that no hand save our own could
lay bare the grisly spectre that lurked within.
Yet our own knowledge, or what we had grown
to call conscience, sat in our hearts and mocked
us. Sometime the great white light swept into
the hidden places, there was a tug at our heartstrings,
and behold the seal had fallen away.
And in that church, my father added slowly,
&#8220;he doubted whether any one could say that
within him those dark places were not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly his calm, tense eloquence became<a class="page" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="105"></a>
touched with passion. His pale face gleamed,
and his eyes were lit with an inward fire. Gesture
and tone moved to the beat of a deeper
and more subtle rhetoric. He was pleading for
those whose sin beat about in their bosoms and
lay like a dark shadow across all the sweet
places of life. Passionate and more passionate
he grew. He was pleading&mdash;for whom? We
listened entranced. His terrible earnestness
passed like an electric thrill into the hearts of
all of us. Several women were crying softly;
men sat there with bowed heads, face to face
with ghosts long since buried. Bruce Deville
was sitting back in his corner with folded arms
and downcast head. Adelaide Fortress was
looking steadfastly up towards that pale, inspired
figure, with soft, wet eyes. Even the
Bishop was deeply moved, and was listening to
every word. For my part there was a great
lump in my throat. The sense of some terrible
reality behind my father&#8217;s impassioned words
had left me pale and trembling. A subtle sense
of excitement stole through the church. When
he paused for a moment before his concluding
sentence, there was something almost like a
murmur amongst the congregation, followed by
another period of breathless suspense.</p>

<p>In the midst of that deep hush a faint sound
attracted me. My seat was on a level with the
open door, and I glanced out. A man was lean<a class="page" name="Page_106" id="Page_106" title="106"></a>ing
against the porch&mdash;a man in very grievous
condition. His clothes were disordered and
torn, and there was a great stain on the front
of his coat. I alone had gazed away from the
preacher in the pulpit towards him, and whilst
I looked the sound which had first attracted me
was repeated. A low, faint moan, scarcely
louder than a whisper, passed between his lips.
He stood there supporting himself with his
hands against the wall. His lined face was
turned towards me, and, with a thrill of horror,
I recognized him. I half rose from my seat.
The man was either ill or dying. He seemed
to be making frantic signs to me. I tried my
utmost to signal to Mr. Charlsworth, but, like
all the rest, his eyes seemed riveted upon the
pulpit. Before I could leave my seat, or attract
any one&#8217;s attention, he had staggered
through the door into the church itself. He
stood leaning upon a vacant chair, a wild, disordered
object, with blood stains upon his
hands and clothes, and his dark eyes red and
gleaming fiercely beneath his wind-tossed mass
of black hair.</p>

<p>So fascinated was the congregation that save
myself only one or two stray people had noticed
him. He stood amongst the shadows, and
only I, to whom his profile appeared against the
background of the open door, was able to mark
the full and terrible disorder of his person.<a class="page" name="Page_107" id="Page_107" title="107"></a>
And while I waited, numb with some nameless
fear, the preacher&#8217;s voice rang once more
through the building, and men and women
bowed their heads before the sweet, lingering
passion of those sad words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wages of sin is death. For all things
may pass away save sin. Sin alone is eternal.
Sin alone must stamp itself wherever it touches
with an undying and everlasting mark. Retribution
is like the tides of the sea, which no
man&#8217;s hands can stay; and Death rides his
barque upon the rolling waves. You and I and
every man and woman in this world whom sin
has known&mdash;alas! that there should be so many&mdash;have
looked into his marble face, have felt the
touch of his pitiless hands, and the cold despair
of his unloving embrace. For there is Death
spiritual and Death physical, and many of us
who bear no traces of our past in the present
of to-day, have fought our grim battle with the
death&mdash;the&mdash;death&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then my father&#8217;s words died away upon
his lips, and the whole congregation knew what
had already thrown me into an agony of terror.
The man had struggled to the bottom of the
aisle, and the sound of his shuffling movements,
and the deep groan which accompanied them,
had drawn many eyes towards him. His awful
plight stood revealed with pitiless distinctness
in the open space where he was now standing.<a class="page" name="Page_108" id="Page_108" title="108"></a>
The red blood dripped from his clothing upon
the bare stone floor, a foam which was like
the foam of death frothed at his lips. He stood
there, the focus of all horrified eyes, swaying
to and fro as though on the eve of collapse, his
arms outstretched, and his eyes flashing red
fire upon the thin almost spectral-like figure of
the preacher now leaning over towards him
from the pulpit. The slight color forced into
my father&#8217;s cheeks by the physical effort of his
impassioned oratory died away. To his very
lips he was white as the surplice he wore. Yet
he did not lose his nerve or falter for a moment.
He motioned to Mr. Charlsworth and the other
church wardens, and both left their places and
hurried down the aisle towards the wild, tragical
looking figure. Just as they reached him
the cry which his lips had twice declined to utter
burst out upon the tense, breathless silence. He
made a convulsive movement forward as though
to spring like a wild cat upon that calm, dignified
figure looking down upon him with unfaltering
and unflinching gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judas! you, Judas! Oh! my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>His hands, thrown wildly out, fell to his side.
He sank back into the arms of one of those who
had hurried from their places at my father&#8217;s
gesture. A last cry, more awful than anything
I have ever heard, woke hideous
echoes amongst the wormeaten, black oak<a class="page" name="Page_109" id="Page_109" title="109"></a>
beams, and before it had died away, I saw Adelaide
Fortress glide like a black wraith from
her seat and fall on her knees by the fainting
man&#8217;s side. My father lifted up his arms, and
with a deep, solemn tremor in his tone pronounced
the Benediction. Then, with his surplice
flying round him, he came swiftly down
the aisle between the little crowd of horrified
people. They all fell back at his approach. He
sank on one knee by the side of the prostrate
man and looked steadfastly into his face. The
congregation all waited in their places, and
Alice, who was only partly aware of what was
going on, commenced to play a soft voluntary.</p>

<p>There was some whispering for a moment or
two, then they lifted him up and carried the
lifeless body out into the open air.</p>

<p>My father followed close behind. For a few
minutes there was an uneasy silence. People
forgot that the Benediction had been pronounced,
and were uncertain whether to go or
stay. Then some one made a start, and one by
one they got up and left the church.</p>

<p>Lady Naselton paused and sat by my side for
a moment. She was trembling all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who it was?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure. It was a stranger; was it
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" title="110"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;It was either a stranger, or my guest, Mr.
Berdenstein. I only caught a glimpse of his
face for a moment, and I could not be sure. He
looked so horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, and suddenly discovered that I
was half fainting. &#8220;Come out into the air,&#8221; she
whispered. I got up and went out with her
just in time.</p>

<p>They had carried him into a distant corner
of the churchyard. My father, when he saw us
standing together in a little group, came slowly
over as though to check our further advance.
His face was haggard and drawn. He seemed
to walk with difficulty, and underneath his surplice
I could see that one hand was pressed to
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is dead,&#8221; he said, quietly. &#8220;There
must have been an accident or a fight. No one
seems to know where he came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; remarked the Bishop, thoughtfully,
&#8220;why he should have dragged himself up
to the church in such a plight. One of those
cottages or the Vicarage would have been
nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; my father answered, gravely, &#8220;he
was struggling for sanctuary.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Bishop held up his right hand towards
the sky with a solemn gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;God grant that he may have found it,&#8221; he
prayed.</p>

<span class="chap">CANON OF BELCHESTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> followed for me after these solemn
words of the Bishop a phantasmagoria of human
faces, and sky, and tree-tops, and a singing
in my ears, now loud, now soft, in which
all other sounds and movements seemed
blended. I have an indistinct recollection of
the walk home, and of finding myself in my own
room. Then memory gradually faded away
from me. Blank unconsciousness enveloped
me like a cloud. The next thing I remember
is waking up one morning as though after a terrible
dream, a night of nightmares, and finding
the room half full of medicine bottles. I looked
around me faintly curious, inexpressibly bewildered;
I suddenly realized that I had been ill.</p>

<p>I was not alone. Alice was standing over
me, her round, honest little face beaming with
pleasure and her underlip quivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are better,&#8221; she said, softly. &#8220;I am so
glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have I been here?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She sat down by my side.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_112" id="Page_112" title="112"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;A week to-morrow! Just think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I closed my eyes. The little scene in the
churchyard had suddenly risen up again before
my eyes. My head commenced to swim. I
asked no more questions.</p>

<p>The next morning I was stronger. I sat up
in bed and looked around. The first thing
which I noticed was that the room was full of
the most beautiful flowers; I stooped over a
vase of roses and smelt them. The air was almost
faint with their delicious perfume.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did they all come from?&#8221; I asked
Alice.</p>

<p>She laughed in rather an odd manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom do you suppose?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; I protested, faintly.
&#8220;I have not an idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the <i>b&ecirc;te noir</i>,&#8221; she exclaimed, plucking
off one of the yellow blossoms and placing
it upon my pillow.</p>

<p>I still looked blankly at her. She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you really guess?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. I really had no idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Mr. Deville. He has called nearly
every day to ask after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was surprising enough, but I said very little.
I suppose I was not considered strong
enough then to hear any news of importance;
but several days later, when I was sitting up,
Alice looked up from the book she was reading<a class="page" name="Page_113" id="Page_113" title="113"></a>
aloud to me and told me something which I
know she must have had very hard work to
have kept to herself for so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is to be made a canon, Kate,&#8221; she
said, triumphantly. I looked up at her bewildered.
I had forgotten all about Lady Naselton&#8217;s
plans on his behalf. The latter part of
this terrible Sunday had haunted me like a
nightmare, usurping all my thoughts. There
had been little room for other memories.</p>

<p>&#8220;A canon!&#8221; I repeated, feebly. &#8220;Do you
mean it, Alice?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bishop came here from Lady Naselton&#8217;s.
He said a lot of nice things to father
about his sermon on&mdash;that Sunday night&mdash;you
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a wonderful sermon,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the Bishop thinks; so every one thinks,&#8221;
Alice declared, with enthusiasm. &#8220;I shall never
forget how I felt. And he had no notes, or
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the most realistic sermon I ever
heard,&#8221; I said, with a little shudder. &#8220;It was
like a scene from a play. It was wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked up at me quickly. Doubtless
my voice had betrayed some agitation. She
laid her hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about it this evening,&#8221; she
begged. &#8220;I quite forgot father especially for<a class="page" name="Page_114" id="Page_114" title="114"></a>bade
my speaking of it to you. It must have
been terrible for you to have been so near it all.
I can&#8217;t imagine what I should have done. I
could see nothing from the organ screen, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I leaned over and looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alice, I do not want to talk about it, but I
want to know how it ended. You must tell me
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was quite dead,&#8221; she said, slowly.
&#8220;There was an inquest, and they decided that
he must have been attacked somewhere in the
wood between the downs and Yellow House.
There were all the marks of a struggle within
a few hundred yards of the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they bring in a verdict of murder?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>Alice nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, gravely. &#8220;He was murdered.
It seems that he was lately come from
abroad. He had been staying at Lady Naselton&#8217;s,
but she knew scarcely anything about
him. He was kind to her son abroad. I think
they just know his name and that was all. They
had no idea where to send to or if he had any
near relatives alive. It was all very odd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he robbed?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. His watch and money were found in
his pocket undisturbed. If anything was taken<a class="page" name="Page_115" id="Page_115" title="115"></a>
from it it must have been papers only. The
police are trying hard to find a clue, but they
say that it is a very difficult case. No one
seems to have seen him at all after he left Naselton
Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>I caught at the side of my chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one at all?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment. The walls of my
little chamber had suddenly opened. I saw
again from the edge of the moor that lone figure
coming down the hillside towards us, I saw
that strange light flashing in my father&#8217;s face,
and I heard the greeting of the two men. A
sick dread was in my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was father called as a witness?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why should he be? The man was a
stranger to him. He had never seen him before.&#8221;</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and laid back. Alice bent
over me anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not to have talked about this to
you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Father absolutely forbade me
to, but you wanted to know the end so much.
Promise not to think of it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promise not to think of it any more? Ah!
if only I could have made that promise and
kept it. My sister&#8217;s protesting words seemed
charged with the subtlest and most bitter of all
irony. Already some faint premonition of the<a class="page" name="Page_116" id="Page_116" title="116"></a>
burden which I was to bear seemed dawning
upon me. I remained silent and kept my eyes
closed. Alice thought that I was asleep, but I
knew that sleep was very far off. The white,
distorted face of that dying man was before me.
I saw the silent challenge and the silent duel
which had passed between those two, the central
figures in that marvellous little drama&mdash;one,
the challenger, ghastly pale even to the
tremulous lips, wild and dishevelled, my father
looking down upon him with unquailing mien
and proud, still face. One moment more of
life, a few beats more of the pulses, and that
sentence&mdash;and that sentence&mdash;what would it
have grown to? I felt myself shivering as I lay
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say that father was away now?&#8221; I
asked Alice.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he is staying with the Bishop for a few
days. I should not be surprised if he came
home to-day, though. I have written to him
by every post to let him know how you are,
and he was most anxious to hear directly you
were well enough to talk. I have been disobeying
him frightfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I closed my eyes and feigned sleep. I
had heard what Alice had not, the sound of
wheels below. Suddenly she laid down her<a class="page" name="Page_117" id="Page_117" title="117"></a>
work and started up. It was my father&#8217;s voice
bidding the cabman &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go down to him, Kate,&#8221; she declared,
springing up; &#8220;I won&#8217;t leave you alone for more
than a minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when the minute or two had elapsed and
there was a knock at my door, it was not Alice
who had returned. I answered in a low voice,
and my father entered.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="chap">THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUD</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> my low chair I watched my father
cross the room. So far as I could see there
was no change in him. He came over to my
side and took my hand with an air of anxious
kindliness. Then he stooped down, and his lips
touched my forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are better, Kate?&#8221; he inquired, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite well,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>He looked at me thoughtfully, and asked a
few questions about my illness, touched upon
his own visit to the Bishop, and the dignity
which had been offered to him. Then after a
short pause, during which my heart beat
fiercely, he came and sat down by my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kate! You are strong enough to listen to
me while I speak just for a moment or two upon
a very painful subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gather from what Alice tells me that you
have already shown a very wise discretion&mdash;in
a certain matter. You have already alluded to
it, it seems, and she has told you all that is<a class="page" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" title="119"></a>
known. Something, of course, must have at
once occurred to you&mdash;I mean the fact that I
have not thought it well to disclose the fact
that you and I together met that unfortunate
man on the common, and that he asked me the
way to the Yellow House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was bewildered when I found that you
had not mentioned it,&#8221; I faltered. &#8220;I do not
understand. Please tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked steadily into my eyes. There was
not the slightest disquietude in his still, stern
face. My nervousness did not affect him at all.
He seemed to feel no embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a matter,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;to which
I gave a good deal of thought at the time. I
came to the conclusion that for my own sake
and for the sake of another that the fact of that
meeting had better not be known. There are
things concerning it which I may not tell you.
I cannot offer you as I would like my whole
confidence. Only I can say this, my disclosure
of the fact of our having met the man could
have done not one iota of good. It could not
possibly have suggested to any one either a
clue as to the nature of the crime or to the criminal
himself, and bearing in mind other things
of which you are happier to remain ignorant,
silence became to me almost a solemn duty.
It became at any rate an absolute necessity.
For the sake of others as well as for my own<a class="page" name="Page_120" id="Page_120" title="120"></a>
sake I held my peace. Association direct or indirect
with such a crime would have been
harmful alike to me and to the person whom he
desired to visit. So I held my peace, and I require
of you, Kate, that you take my pledged
word as to the necessity for this silence, and
that you follow my example. I desire your solemn
promise that no word of that meeting shall
ever pass your lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not answer. With his eyes fixed upon
my face he waited. I laid my hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, in the church, did you see his face?
Did you hear what he was saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not shrink from me. He looked into
my white, eager face without any sign of fear
or displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it&mdash;was it&mdash;you to whom he spoke?&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer you that question, Kate,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>I grasped his hand feverishly. There was a
red livid mark afterwards where my nails had
dug into his wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, would you have me go mad?&#8221; I
moaned. &#8220;You know that man. You knew
who he was! You knew what he wanted&mdash;at
the Yellow House.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_121" id="Page_121" title="121"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the church I could have touched&mdash;could
have touched him, he was so near to me&mdash;there
was a terrible light in his face, his eyes
were flaming upon you. He was like a man
who suddenly understands. He called &#8216;Judas,&#8217;
and he pointed&mdash;at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was mad,&#8221; my father answered, with a
terrible calmness. &#8220;Every one could see that
he was mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad!&#8221; I caught at the thought. I repeated
the word to myself, and forced my recollection
backwards with a little shudder to those few
horrible moments. After all was there any
hope that this might be the interpretation? My
father&#8217;s voice broke in upon my thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to harp upon what must be
a terribly painful subject to you, Kate. I only
want your promise, you must take my word
for everything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him long and steadily. If the
faces of men are in any way an index to their
lives, my father&#8217;s should rank high&mdash;high indeed.
His countenance was absolutely unruffled.
There was not a single shadow of fear
there, or passion of any sort; only a delicate
thoughtfulness tempered with that quiet dignity
which seemed almost an inseparable characteristic
of his. I took his hands in mine and
clasped them fervently.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_122" id="Page_122" title="122"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;give me your whole confidence.
I will promise all that you desire, only
let me know everything. I have thought sometimes&mdash;terrible
thoughts&mdash;I cannot help them.
They torment me now&mdash;they will torment me
always. I know so much&mdash;tell me a little more.
My lips shall be sealed. I mean it! Only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his hand softly, but the words died
upon my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to tell you, child,&#8221; he said,
quietly. &#8220;Put that thought away from you forever.
The burden which I bear is upon my
own shoulders only. God forbid that even the
shadow of it should darken your young life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of any knowledge,&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;It is ignorance of which I am afraid. I can
bear anything except these horrible, nameless
fears against which I have no power. Why
don&#8217;t you trust me? I am old enough. I am
wise enough. What you tell me shall be as
sacred as God&#8217;s word to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head without any further response.
I choked back the tears from my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some mystery, here,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;We
are all enveloped in it. What does it mean?
Why did we come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came here by pure accident,&#8221; my father
answered. &#8220;We came here because the curacy
was offered to me; and I was glad to take any<a class="page" name="Page_123" id="Page_123" title="123"></a>thing
which relieved me of my duties at Belchester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fate!&mdash;a cruel fate!&#8221; I moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the will of God,&#8221; he answered,
sternly.</p>

<p>Then there was a silence between us, unbroken
for many minutes. My father waited by
my side&mdash;waited for my answer. The despair
in my heart grew deeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot live here,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and remain
ignorant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must give me your promise, child,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I have no power to tell you anything.
You are young, and for you the terror of this
thing will fade away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered him then with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; I said, faintly. &#8220;Only&mdash;I shall
have to go away. I cannot live here. It would
drive me mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>His cold lips touched mine as he rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do,&#8221; he said, gravely, &#8220;what
seems best to you. You are old enough to be
the moulder of your own life. If you would be
happier away, you must go. Only there is this
to be remembered&mdash;I can understand that this
particular place may have become distasteful to
you. We are not going to live here any longer.
You will find life at Eastminster larger and
more absorbing. I shall be able to do more for
you than I have ever done before.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" title="124"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;It is not that,&#8221; I interrupted, wearily. &#8220;You
know that it is not that. It is between us two.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent. A sudden change stole into
his face. His lips quivered. An inexpressible
sorrow gleamed for a moment in his dark eyes.
He bent his head. Was that a tear that fell? I
fancied so.</p>

<p>I took his hand and soothed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, you will tell me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; I
whispered. &#8220;I shall not mind. I will be brave,
whatever dreadful things I may have to know.
Let me share the burden.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment I thought that he was yielding.
He covered his face with his hands and remained
silent. But when he looked up I saw
that the moment of weakness had passed. He
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Kate,&#8221; he said, quietly. &#8220;Thank
you for your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart sank. I returned his kiss coldly.
He left me without another word.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="chap">MR. BERDENSTEIN&#8217;S SISTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days after that memorable conversation
with my father a fly drove up to the door,
and from where I was sitting in our little drawing
room I heard a woman&#8217;s anxious voice inquiring
for Mr. Ffolliot. A moment or two
later the maid knocked at my door.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a young lady here, miss, inquiring
for the Vicar. I told her that Mr. Ffolliot
would not be in for an hour or two, and she
asked if she could speak to any other member
of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what she wants, Mary?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, miss. She would not say what her business
was. She just wants to see one of you,
she said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better tell her that I am at home,
and show her in here if she wishes to see me,&#8221; I
directed.</p>

<p>She ushered in a young lady, short, dark, and
thin. Her eyes were swollen as though with
weeping, and her whole appearance seemed to<a class="page" name="Page_126" id="Page_126" title="126"></a>
indicate that she was in trouble. She sank into
the chair to which I motioned her, and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must please forgive me,&#8221; she exclaimed,
in a voice broken with sobs. &#8220;I have
just come from abroad, and I have had a terrible
shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some instinct seemed to tell me the truth.</p>

<p>My heart stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you any relation of the gentleman who
was&mdash;who died here last week?&#8221; I asked,
quickly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just been to the police station,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It is his watch&mdash;the one I gave him&mdash;and
his pocket book, with a half-written letter
to me in it. They have shown me his photograph.
It is my brother, Stephen Berdenstein.
He was the only relative I had left in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was really shocked, and I looked at her
pitifully. &#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It must be
terrible for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She commenced to sob again, and I feared
she would have hysterics. She was evidently
very nervous, and very much overwrought. I
was never particularly good at administering
consolation, and I could think of nothing better
to do than to ring the bell and order some
tea.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_127" id="Page_127" title="127"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;He was to have joined me in Paris on Saturday,&#8221;
she continued after a minute or two.
&#8220;He did not come and he sent a message.
When Monday morning came and there was
no letter from him, I felt sure that something
had happened. I bought the English papers,
and by chance I read about the murder. It
seemed absurd to connect it with Stephen, especially
as he told me he was going to be in
London, but the description was so like him
that I could not rest. I telegraphed to his bankers,
and they replied that he had gone down
into the country, but had left no address. So
I crossed at once, and when I found that he had
not been heard of at his club in London or anywhere
else for more than ten days, I came down
here. I went straight to the police station, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into tears again. I came over to
her side and tried my best to be sympathetic.
I am afraid that it was not a very successful attempt,
for my thoughts were wholly engrossed
in another direction. However, I murmured a
few platitudes, and presently she became more
coherent. She even accepted some tea, and
bathed her face with some eau de Cologne,
which I fetched from my room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any idea,&#8221; I asked her presently,
&#8220;why your brother came to this part of the<a class="page" name="Page_128" id="Page_128" title="128"></a>
country at all. He was staying at Lady Naselton&#8217;s,
was he not? Was she an old friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard him speak of her in my life.
He wrote me of a young Mr. Naselton who had
visited him in Rio, but even in his last letter
from Southampton he did not say a word about
visiting them. He would have come straight
to me, he said, but for a little urgent business
in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet he seems to have accepted a casual
invitation, and came down here within a day or
two of his arrival in England,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand it!&#8221; she exclaimed, passionately.
&#8220;Stephen and I have not met for
many years&mdash;he has been living in South
America, and I have been in Paris&mdash;but he
wrote to me constantly, and in every letter he
repeated how eagerly he was looking forward
to seeing me again. I cannot think that he
would have come down here just as an ordinary
visit of civility before coming to me, or sending
for me to come to him. There must be
something behind it&mdash;something of which I do
not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, of course, that Naselton Hall is
shut up and that the Naseltons have gone to
Italy?&#8221; I asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me so at the police station,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;I have sent Lady Naselton a tele<a class="page" name="Page_129" id="Page_129" title="129"></a>gram.
It is a long time since I saw Stephen,
and one does not tell everything in letters. He
may have formed great friendships of which I
have never heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or great enmities,&#8221; I suggested, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or enmities,&#8221; she repeated, thoughtfully.
&#8220;Yes; he may have made enemies. That is possible.
He was passionate, and he was wilful.
He was the sort of a man who made enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was quite calm now, and I had a good
look at her. She was certainly plain. Her face
was sharp and thin, and her eyes were a dull,
dark color. She was undersized and ungraceful,
in addition to which she was dressed much
too richly for traveling, and in questionable
taste. So far as I could recollect there was not
the slightest resemblance between her and the
dead man.</p>

<p>She surprised me in the middle of my scrutiny,
but she did not seem to notice it. She
had evidently been thinking something out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not lived here very long, Miss
Ffolliot?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a month or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;you know the
names of most of the principal families round
here. A good many of them would call upon
you, no doubt?&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_130" id="Page_130" title="130"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I know most of them, by name at
any rate,&#8221; I told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any family of the name of Maltabar?&#8221;
she asked&mdash;&#8220;particularly a man called
Philip Maltabar?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head at once with a sense of relief
which I could not altogether conceal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never heard it in my life,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I am quite sure that there is no family of that
name of any consequence around here. I must
have heard it, and it is too uncommon a one to
be overlooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brief light died out of her face. She was
evidently disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Philip Maltabar is
the one man I know who hated my brother.
There has been a terrible and lifelong enmity
between them. It has lasted since they were
boys. I believe that it was to avoid him that
my brother first went to South America. If
there had been a Maltabar living anywhere
around here I should have known where to go
for vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it well to think of that, and so soon?&#8221; I
asked, quietly. The girl&#8217;s aspect had changed.
I looked away from her with a little shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else is there for me to think of?&#8221; she<a class="page" name="Page_131" id="Page_131" title="131"></a>
demanded. &#8220;Supposing it were you, it would
be different. You have other relatives. I have
none. I am left alone in the world. My
brother may have had his faults, but to me he
was everything. Can you wonder that I hate
the person who has deprived me of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not sure&mdash;it is not certain that
there was not an accident&mdash;that he did not kill
himself,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>She dismissed the idea with scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accident! What accident could there have
been? It is not possible. As to taking his own
life, it is ridiculous! Why should he? He was
too fond of it. Other men might have done
that, but Stephen&mdash;never! No. He was murdered
in that little plantation. I know the
exact spot. I have been there. There was a
struggle, and some one, better prepared than
he, killed him. Perhaps he was followed here
from London. It may be so. And yet, what
was he doing here at all? That visit to Naselton
Hall was not without some special purpose.
I am sure of it. It was in connection with that
purpose that he met with his death. He must
have come to see some one. I want to know
who it was. That is what I am going to find
out&mdash;whom he came to see. You can blame me
if you like. It may be unchristian, and you are
a parson&#8217;s daughter. I do not care. I am
going to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_132" id="Page_132" title="132"></a></p>

<p>I was silent. In a measure I was sorry for
her, but down in my heart there lurked the
seeds of a fear&mdash;nameless, but terribly potent&mdash;which
put me out of all real sympathy with her.
I began to wish that she would go away. I had
answered her questions, and I had done all&mdash;more&mdash;than
common courtesy demanded. Yet
she sat there without any signs of moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said at last, finding that I
kept silent, &#8220;that it would not be of any use
waiting to see your father. He has not been
here any longer than you have. He would not
be any more likely to know anything of the
man Maltabar?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would be far less likely to know of him
than I should,&#8221; I assured her. &#8220;He knows a
good deal less of the people around here. His
interests are altogether amongst the poorer
classes. And he has left my sister and me to
receive and pay all the calls. He is not at all
fond of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip Maltabar may be poor&mdash;now,&#8221; she
said musingly. &#8220;He was never rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he were poor, he would not be living
here,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The poor of whom I speak are
the peasantry. It is not like a town, you know.
Any man such as the Mr. Maltabar you speak
of would be more than ever a marked figure
living out of his class amongst villagers. In<a class="page" name="Page_133" id="Page_133" title="133"></a>
any case he would not be the sort of man whom
my father would be likely to visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right,&#8221; she answered,
doubtfully. &#8220;At any rate&mdash;since I am here&mdash;there
would be no harm in asking your father,
would there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I daresay he
will be here in a few moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost as I spoke he passed the window,
and I heard his key in the front door. The
girl, who had seen his shadow, looked up
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that he?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You can ask him for yourself now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I am so
glad I stayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some instinct prompted me to rise and leave
the room. I went out and met my father in the
hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; I said, &#8220;there is a girl here who
says she has identified that man. She is his
sister. She is waiting to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father had evidently come in tired out;
he leaned against the wall for support. He was
out of breath, too, and pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she want with me?&#8221; he asked,
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;She came to ask if we knew of any family
of the name of Maltabar. Philip Maltabar, it<a class="page" name="Page_134" id="Page_134" title="134"></a>
seems, is the name of a man who has been her
brother&#8217;s enemy. She thinks that this thing
must have been his doing. She cannot think of
any one else with whom he has ever been on
bad terms. I have told her that there is no one
of that name in these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. He was very hoarse
and ghastly pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right, Kate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no
one of that name around here. What more
does she want? What does she want of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her that I knew of no one, but she
came to see you in the first place. She does
not seem quite satisfied. She wants to ask you
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew back a step.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! I cannot see her. I am tired&mdash;ill.
I have walked too far. Tell her from me that
there is no one of that name living in these
parts. I am absolutely sure of it. She can
take it for granted from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better see her just for one moment,
as she has waited for so long?&#8221; I said.
&#8220;She will be better satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ground his heel down into the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I will not! I have had too much
worry and trouble in connection with this affair
already. My nerves are all unstrung. I cannot
discuss it again with any one. Please let her
understand that from me as kindly as possible,<a class="page" name="Page_135" id="Page_135" title="135"></a>
but firmly. I am going to my study. Don&#8217;t
come to see me again until she has gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the hall and entered his own
room. I heard the key turn in the lock after
him. It was useless to say anything more. I
went back to my visitor.</p>

<p>I entered noiselessly, as I was wearing house
shoes, and was surprised to find her with the
contents of my card-plate spread out before
her. She flushed up to the temples when she
saw me standing on the threshold, yet she was
not particularly apologetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very rude,&#8221; she said, brusquely. &#8220;I
had no right, of course, to take such a liberty,
but I thought&mdash;it might be barely possible&mdash;that
you had forgotten the name, that some one
might have called when you were not at home,
or that, perhaps, your sister might have met
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pray satisfy yourself,&#8221; I said, icily.
&#8220;You are quite welcome to look them
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put the card-plate down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have looked at all of them,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;There is no name anything like it there. Is
your father coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not very well,&#8221; I told her, &#8220;and is
quite tired out. He has walked a long way this
afternoon. He wishes you to excuse him, and
to say that he is quite sure that there is no one<a class="page" name="Page_136" id="Page_136" title="136"></a>
of that name, rich or poor, living anywhere in
this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed by no means satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But shall I not be able to see him at all,
then?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I had hoped that as
he was the clergyman here, and was one of
those who were with my brother when he died,
that he would be certain to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that you will think it very
selfish,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but my father would rather
not see you at all. He is in very delicate
health, and this affair has already been a terrible
shock to him. He does not want to have
anything more to do with it directly or indirectly.
He wants to forget it if he can. He
desires me to offer you his most sincere sympathy.
But you must really excuse him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose slowly to her feet; her manner was
obviously ungracious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of course if he
has made up his mind not to see me, I cannot
insist. At the same time, I think it very
strange. Good afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rang the bell, and walked with her to the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything else which I can do for
you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I think I shall telegraph to<a class="page" name="Page_137" id="Page_137" title="137"></a>
London for a detective. I shall see what they
say at the police station. Good afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not offer to shake hands, nor did I.
I think of all the women I had ever met, I detested
her the most.</p>

<p>I watched her walk down the drive with
short, mincing steps and get into a fly. Then
I went to the door of my father&#8217;s room and
knocked.</p>

<hr class="section-break" />
<div class="section"></div>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_138" id="Page_138" title="138"></a></p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="chap">FOR VENGEANCE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I knocked</span> at the door twice before there was
any answer. Then I heard my father&#8217;s voice
from the other end of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Kate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Can I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The door was not immediately unlocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she gone?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>He opened it then, and I was frightened to
see how ill he looked. He had evidently been
lying down, for the cushions on his sofa were
disarranged.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone away, then,&#8221; he repeated,
anxiously.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she annoyed because I did not see
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was disappointed,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;She
was very ungracious and very disagreeable; a
most objectionable person altogether. I don&#8217;t
know how I managed to be civil with her.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_139" id="Page_139" title="139"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You explained that I was not well&mdash;that I
was not fit to see any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did my best. She was very unreasonable,
and she evidently expected that you would have
made an effort to see her. She went away
grumbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down upon the sofa, and I leaned
against the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she gone back to London?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know, I don&#8217;t think so. She said
something about going back to the police station
and wiring to London for a detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had closed his eyes. I heard him draw
in a long, sharp breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a very determined young woman,&#8221; I
continued. &#8220;Perhaps I ought not to say so,
but she seemed to feel more angry than broken-hearted.
She is vindictive, I am sure. She
will do her best to find the man who killed her
brother, and if she finds him she will have no
mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father rose up and walked to his writing
table. His back was turned to me as he commenced
to sort out some papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that is natural. It is
very hard indeed to remember that vengeance
belongs to God, and not to man. It is very
hard indeed. Leave me now, Kate, and see
that I am not disturbed for an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" title="140"></a></p>

<p>I closed his door softly, and walked out into
the garden, across the lawn to the edge. Below
me was the little plantation, ill-famed and suddenly
notorious as the scene of that terrible
tragedy. Every tree seemed clearly defined
and beautiful in that soft autumn twilight. I
looked at it with a curious sense of shuddering
fear. That girl&#8217;s face, hungry for vengeance,
the code of blood for blood&mdash;it was terrible.
But the vengeance of God&mdash;more awful, if not
so swift as hers&mdash;on whom was that to fall?</p>

<p>A heavy step in the road brought me, with a
little sense of relief, back to the present. The
tall form of Mr. Bruce Deville came in sight.
He passed so close to me that I could have
touched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said, softly, in
his ear.</p>

<p>He started almost over to the other side of
the road. Then he saw me, and lifted his cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I beg your
pardon, Miss Ffolliot. How you startled me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; I said, penitently.</p>

<p>He looked at me and laughed. &#8220;You may
be,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but you don&#8217;t look it. I am glad
that you are better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite well, thank you,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I
am glad to see you, Mr. Deville. I wanted to
thank you for those beautiful roses. I could
not believe that they came from you.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_141" id="Page_141" title="141"></a></p>

<p>He looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not worth mentioning,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Besides, it was Adelaide&#8217;s idea. She
thought that you would like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt a little needlessly disappointed. Doubtless
I answered him a little coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must thank Mrs. Fortress for them, then!
Very well; I will go down and see her to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; he said, with a slight twinkle
in his eyes, &#8220;that you need go down specially.
Mrs. Fortress only answered my question when
I asked her if she thought that you would care
for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that all?&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Entirely,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;At the same time,
if you have any time to spare I daresay Mrs.
Fortress would be glad to see you if you went
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she would, really?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;You know the first time I was there, something
a little unpleasant happened in connection
with my father. I took a great fancy to
her, and I would like to go and see her again,
but I am not sure whether she wants me. I
fancy she was very surprised at my visit the
other night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly certain,&#8221; he declared, confidently,
&#8220;that she would be glad to see you any<a class="page" name="Page_142" id="Page_142" title="142"></a>
time you chose to go to her. You may take
my word for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I will go to-morrow, then,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Mrs. Fortress interests me very much. There
is no one else round here like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very friendly with my godmamma,
are you not?&#8221; he said, with a faint smile at the
corners of his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Naselton has been very kind to me,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid she gives me a dreadful character,
doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she does you probably deserve it,&#8221; I said,
severely. &#8220;I fancy that I have heard her say
that you are exceedingly shiftless and very lazy.
You could scarcely deny that, could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I have
walked twenty or thirty miles to-day. That
doesn&#8217;t sound particularly lazy, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On sport or business?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>He laughed, and looked down at himself. His
clothes were splashed with mud, and a bramble
had torn his coat in a fresh place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I maintain that it is immaterial,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been out all day, and I haven&#8217;t
sat down for more than an hour. Therefore I
deny the laziness <i>in toto</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;there is another
charge against you, which you certainly can&#8217;t
deny.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_143" id="Page_143" title="143"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Untidiness! We used to have a woman call
upon us at Belchester to buy our old clothes.
If ever she comes here I shall certainly send
her up to Deville Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would; I&#8217;d sell her the whole
lot. Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other things,&#8221; I said, &#8220;were too bad to
repeat. I have only been enumerating your
minor faults.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made me an ironical bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am exceedingly obliged to my godmother,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Some day I shall do myself
the pleasure of paying her a visit and suggesting
that she should mind her own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your business is her business to the extent
of her godmotherhood,&#8221; I reminded him,
suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang her godmotherhood!&#8221; he uttered under
his breath. I think it was &#8220;hang&#8221; he said&mdash;I
was not sure about the expletive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go away,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You are getting
profane. You are still as rude as when I bound
your dog&#8217;s leg for you, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was suddenly grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;That seems a long time ago,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week or two only,&#8221; I reminded him. &#8220;It
seems longer, because of all that has happened.
That reminds me, Mr. Deville. I wanted to<a class="page" name="Page_144" id="Page_144" title="144"></a>
speak to you&mdash;about&mdash;that Sunday&mdash;the murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head, and whistled to his dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t talk about it,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;You
ought not to want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not well enough. I don&#8217;t wonder
that you&#8217;ve been ill. You must have been within
a few yards of the fellow all the time. Certainly
you must not talk about it. Good evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is something I want to ask you,&#8221;
I continued.</p>

<p>He shook his head. He was already moving
away. I called him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville! One moment, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you just one thing about that
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was talking to empty space. Bruce Deville
was already almost out of sight, striding along
across the short turf, with his broad back turned
to me. Soon he had vanished amongst the
shadows. There was nothing for me to do but
to return to the house.</p>

<span class="chap">ADELAIDE FORTRESS&#8217;S GUEST</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father did not appear at breakfast time
the next morning, and Alice, who took him up
some tea, came down in some concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is not getting up until this afternoon,
at any rate,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;He is very
unwell. I wish he would let us send for a doctor.
He has looked so dreadfully ill since he
came back from London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I was perhaps less
alarmed than I might have otherwise been. It
was clear to me that he did not wish to see the
girl who had called upon me yesterday. I was
strongly inclined to look upon his present indisposition
as somewhat exaggerated with a
view to escaping a meeting with her. But I
was soon to be undeceived. I went up to him
after breakfast, and, gaining no answer to my
knock at the door, I entered softly. He was
lying quite still upon the bed, partially dressed,
and at first I thought that he was asleep. I
moved to his side on tiptoe, and a sudden shock
of fear drove the color from my face, and set<a class="page" name="Page_146" id="Page_146" title="146"></a>
my heart beating wildly. His eyes were closed,
his cheeks were pale as death. Upon his side,
underneath his waistcoat, was a linen bandage,
half soaked with blood. Evidently he had
fainted in the act of fastening it.</p>

<p>I got some brandy and forced it between his
lips, chafed his hands, and gradually the life
seemed to return to him. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move!&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;I will see to
the bandage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay quite still, groaning every now and
then until I had finished. Then I drew the
counterpane over him and waited for a moment
or two. He opened his eyes and looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to send for a doctor,&#8221; I whispered,
leaning over him.</p>

<p>He clutched my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forbid it,&#8221; he answered, hoarsely. &#8220;Do
not dare to think of it, Kate! Do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is serious!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You will be
very ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only a flesh wound,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I
scarcely feel it; only&mdash;I drew the bandage too
tightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you had it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He looked towards the door; it was closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I was in London. It was a cowardly
attack&mdash;the night before I returned. I have<a class="page" name="Page_147" id="Page_147" title="147"></a>
gone armed ever since. I am safe now&mdash;quite
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was sorely perplexed. He was watching me
with bright, feverish eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise, Kate, that you will not send for a
doctor, unless I give you leave,&#8221; he whispered,
eagerly. &#8220;Your solemn promise, Kate; I must
have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On condition that you let me see to the
bandages for you then,&#8221; I answered, reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good! You can. They will want
changing to-night. I am going to sleep now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and turned his face to the
wall. I stole softly out of the room and down
stairs. The sight of Alice&#8217;s calm and placid
features as she busied herself about the affairs
of the house and the parish was a constant irritation
to me. I could not sit down or settle to
any work. A fit of nervous restlessness came
over me. Outside was a storm of wind and
rain but even that I felt at last was better than
inaction; so I put on my coat and hat and
walked across the soddened turf and down the
drive with the fresh, stinging rain in my face. I
passed out into the road, and after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation took the turn towards the Yellow
House.</p>

<p>I do not know what prompted me to go and
see Adelaide Fortress. It was a sudden impulse,
and I yielded to it promptly. But I had<a class="page" name="Page_148" id="Page_148" title="148"></a>
scarcely taken half a dozen steps before I found
myself face to face with Bruce Deville. He
stopped short, and looked at me with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not afraid of rough weather, Miss
Ffolliot,&#8221; he remarked, raising his cap, with,
for him, unusual courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear many things worse,&#8221; I answered, looking
down into the wood. &#8220;Are you going to
see Mrs. Fortress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, presently,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;In the meantime,
I was rather thinking&mdash;I want a word
with your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; I asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>He looked at me intently. There was a new
look upon his face which I scarcely understood.
Was it pity. It was almost like it. He seemed
to be wondering how much I knew&mdash;or surmised.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a matter of some importance,&#8221; he said,
gravely. &#8220;I wish I could tell you. You look
sensible, like a girl who might be told.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words did not offend me in the least. On
the contrary, I think that I was pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said, firmly, &#8220;I agree with
you. I am a girl who might be told. I only
wish that my father would be open with me.
There is some mystery around, some danger. I
can see it all in your faces; I can feel it in the
air. That man&#8217;s death&#8221;&mdash;I pointed into the
wood&mdash;&#8220;is concerned in it. What does it all<a class="page" name="Page_149" id="Page_149" title="149"></a>
mean? I want to know. I want you to tell
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me who that man was, and who killed
him?&#8221; I asked, firmly. &#8220;I have a right to
know. I am determined to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was certainly paler underneath the dark
tan of his sun and weather-burned cheeks. Yet
he answered me steadily enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my advice, Miss Ffolliot, ask no questions
about it, have no thought about it. Put
it away from you. I speak for your happiness,
which, perhaps, I am more interested in than
you would believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards I wondered at that moment of
embarrassment, and the little break in his voice.
Just then the excitement of the moment made
me almost oblivious of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are telling me!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not telling you; I am not telling you
because I do not know. For God&#8217;s sake ask
me no more questions! Come and see Adelaide
Fortress. You were going there, were
you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was going there,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go together,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She will
be glad to see you, I am sure. Mind the mud;
it&#8217;s horribly slippery.&#8221;</p>

<p>We descended the footpath together. Just
as we reached the gates of the Yellow House,
I turned to him.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_150" id="Page_150" title="150"></a></p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the one to whom you should appeal,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I have not the right to tell
you anything; you may know very soon. In
the meantime, will you tell me where your
father is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is at home,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;in bed. He
is ill. I do not think that he will see you. He
is not going to get up to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Deville did not appear in the least disturbed
or disappointed. On the contrary, his
face cleared, and I think that he was relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is better out of the way just for the
present. When does he take up his new appointment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that any definite time has
been fixed,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;In about a month I
should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard about it yesterday,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Your stay here has not been a long one, has
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would to God that we had never come at
all!&#8221; I exclaimed, fervently. &#8220;It has been the
most miserable time in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can echo that wish,&#8221;
he said, with a faint smile. &#8220;Yet so far as you
are concerned, from your point of view, I sup<a class="page" name="Page_151" id="Page_151" title="151"></a>pose
your coming here must have seemed very
unfortunate. It is a pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said, drawing close to his
side, &#8220;I am going to ask you a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at me shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should rather you asked me no question
at all,&#8221; he answered, promptly. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we talk
of other things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we cannot! Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>I laid my hand upon his arm, and forced him
to turn towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of going to see my
father this afternoon,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Can I give him
any message for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that I am sorry to hear of his illness,
but that I am glad that he is taking care
of himself,&#8221; he answered, looking down at me.
&#8220;Tell him that the weather is bad, and that he
will do well to take care of himself. He is better
in his room just at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were inside the gates of the Yellow
House, and I had not time to ask him the meaning
of this unusual solicitude for my father&#8217;s
health. I was still puzzling over it when we
were shown into the drawing room. Then for
a moment I forgot it, and everything else altogether.
Adelaide Fortress had a visitor sitting
opposite to her and talking earnestly.</p>

<p>The conversation ceased suddenly, and she
looked up as we entered. There was no mis<a class="page" name="Page_152" id="Page_152" title="152"></a>taking
the long, sallow face and anxious eyes.
She looked at me with indifference, but at the
sight of my companion she jumped up and a
little cry broke from her lips. Her eyes seemed
to be devouring him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;At last!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="section-break" />

<span class="chap">THE LIKENESS OF PHILIP MALTABAR</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> stood looking at them in wonder. Her
face had seemed suddenly to light up in some
mysterious way, so that for the moment one
quite forgot that she was plain at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is really you!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;How
wonderful!&#8221; She held out both her hands.
Bruce Deville took them a little awkwardly. It
was easy to see that her joy at this meeting
was not altogether reciprocated. But she
seemed utterly unconscious of that. There was
quite a becoming pink flush on her sallow
cheeks, and her dark eyes were wonderfully
soft. Her lips were parted with a smile of welcome,
and showed all her teeth&mdash;she had gleaming
white teeth, beautifully shaped and regular.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that we should meet again like
this,&#8221; she continued, parting with his great
brown hand with some evident reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were bound to meet again some day,&#8221;
he answered, deprecatingly. &#8220;After all, there
is nothing very extraordinary about it. The
world is a small place.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_154" id="Page_154" title="154"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You never kept your promise,&#8221; she reminded
him, reproachfully. &#8220;You never came
near our hotel. I waited for you a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not; I was leaving Baeren that same
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to us at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the most delightful meeting in the
world, so far as I am concerned,&#8221; she declared,
still a little breathlessly. &#8220;Mr. Deville once
saved my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made some sort of a protest, but she took
no notice. She was determined to tell her
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was traveling with a friend through the
Italian lakes, and we were out for a drive near
Baeren. We were coming down a terrible hill,
with a precipice on one side and the sheer
mountain on the other. The road was only
just wide enough for our carriage, and suddenly
a great bird flew out from a hole in the
mountain and startled our horses. The driver
must have been half asleep, and when they
plunged he lost his balance and was thrown
off. The horses started galloping down the
hill. It was almost like the side of a house, and
just in front was a sharp turn, with only a little
frail palisading, and the precipice just below.
We must have gone straight over. He could
not possibly have turned at the pace they were
going. If they had the carriage must have<a class="page" name="Page_155" id="Page_155" title="155"></a>
swung over. We were clinging to one another,
and I am afraid we were dreadful cowards. It
was like certain and fearful death, and just then
Mr. Deville came round the corner. He seemed
to see it all in a moment, and ran to meet us.
Oh, it was horrible!&#8221; she cried, throwing her
hands up with a little shiver. &#8220;I shall never
forget it until I die. Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment. Adelaide Fortress
and I had been hanging over her every word.
There was something very thrilling about the
way she told her story. Mr. Deville alone
seemed uninterested, and a little impatient. He
was turning over the pages of a magazine, with
a restless frown upon his strong, dark face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to me,&#8221; she continued, lowering
her shaking voice, &#8220;that he was down under
the horses, being dragged&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruce Deville closed the magazine he had
been reading with a bang. He had evidently
been a passive auditor as long as he was able
to endure it. &#8220;Let me finish,&#8221; he said, shortly.
&#8220;I am blessed with strong arms, and I stopped
the horses. It was not a particularly difficult
task. The ladies walked back to the hotel, and
I went to look for the driver, who had broken
his leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have never seen him since!&#8221; she exclaimed,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t help that,&#8221; he continued.<a class="page" name="Page_156" id="Page_156" title="156"></a>
&#8220;I believe I promised to come to the hotel and
call upon you, but when I thought it over it
really didn&#8217;t seem worth while. I was on my
way to Geneva, walking over the hills, and I
was rather anxious to get there, and as I found
some men to take the carriage and the driver
back, I thought I might as well continue my
journey. I wanted to get to Geneva for my letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed quietly. Her eyes continually
sought his, soft with admiration and pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are like all the men of your country,
who are brave and noble,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You will
do a great deed, but you do not like to be
thanked. Yet we waited there for days, hoping
to see you. I have looked for you wherever I
have been since then, and to think that now&mdash;on
this very saddest journey I have ever been
forced to take&mdash;that I should call here, by accident,
and the door should open, and you
should walk in. Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite a romance,&#8221; Adelaide Fortress
remarked, with a faint smile upon her lips.
&#8220;How grateful you must be that you came to
see me this afternoon, Bruce! By the by, do
you mind ringing the bell&mdash;unless you prefer
stewed tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up and rang it with avidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you recognize the fact that we
have come to tea,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Miss Ffolliot<a class="page" name="Page_157" id="Page_157" title="157"></a>
and I met at the gate. You ought to give us
something specially good for venturing out on
such a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give you some Buszard&#8217;s cake,&#8221; she
answered, laughing; &#8220;some kind friend sent it
to me this morning. Only you mustn&#8217;t eat it
all up; it has to last me for a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is your father, Miss Ffolliot?&#8221; the girl
asked, turning to me abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say that he is very unwell,&#8221;
I answered, &#8220;and he is obliged to keep to his
room. And I am afraid that he will not be able
to leave it for several days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not appear much concerned. I
watched her closely, and with much relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she remarked, politely. &#8220;However,
so far as I am concerned, I suppose after
all there would be very little object in my seeing
him. I have been to most of the oldest
residents round here, and they all seem certain
that they have never heard of the name Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw Bruce Deville start, and the hand
which held his teacup shook. Adelaide Fortress
and he exchanged swift glances. The girl,
whose eyes were scarcely off him for a moment,
noticed it too, although I doubt if she attached
the same significance to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know&mdash;you have not heard recently
of any one of that name?&#8221; she asked<a class="page" name="Page_158" id="Page_158" title="158"></a>
him. &#8220;Please tell me! I have a reason for being
very much interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have ever heard the name at all it must
have been very long ago,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and certainly
not in connection with this part of the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you do not know who I am, or
why I am here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My name I told
you once, although I daresay you have forgotten
it. It is Berdenstein. The man who was
found dead, who was killed close to here, was
my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>He murmured a few words of sympathy, but
he showed no surprise. I suspected that he had
known who she was and of her presence here
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I came here directly I heard of
it,&#8221; she continued, ignoring us altogether, and
talking only to him. &#8220;It is a terrible trouble
to me, and he was the only relative I had left
in the world. You cannot wonder, can you,
that I want to find out all about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very hard task,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a
task best left, I think, in the hands of the proper
authorities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not know as much as I know,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;He had an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man Maltabar, of whom you spoke?&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_159" id="Page_159" title="159"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was for him I inquired at once.
Yet I suppose I must conclude that he is not
at any rate a resident around here. I thought
that he might have changed his name, and I
have described him to a great many people.
Nobody seems to recognize him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; Adelaide Fortress said,
quietly, &#8220;that you have done all that it is possible
for any one to do? The police are doing
their utmost to solve the mystery of your
brother&#8217;s death. If I were you I should leave it
to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not satisfied to do nothing,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You cannot imagine what it feels like to lose
some one very dear to you in such a terrible
way. I think of it sometimes until I tremble
with passion, and I think that if I could meet
the man who did it face to face, I would stab
him to the heart myself, with my own hands. I
am weak, but I feel that I could do it. I cannot
go away from here if I would. Something
seems to tell me that the key to the whole mystery
lies here&mdash;just at hand. No, I cannot go
away. I must watch and wait. It may come to
me at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one answered her. She was conscious of
a certain antagonism to her, betrayed by our
lack of response to that little outburst and our<a class="page" name="Page_160" id="Page_160" title="160"></a>
averted faces. She looked from one to the
other of us, and finally at Bruce Deville.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least, you must think that I am right,&#8221;
she cried, appealingly. &#8220;You are a man, and
you would feel like that. I am sure of it. Isn&#8217;t
it natural that I should want justice? He was
all I had in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; Bruce Deville said, gently.
&#8220;Nothing can bring him back to life. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated. The girl leaned forward, listening
intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it ever occurred to you,&#8221; he said,
slowly, &#8220;that if a man hated your brother so
much as to follow him down here and kill him,
that so great a hatred must have sprung from
some great cause? I know nothing, of course,
of your brother&#8217;s life, or of the manner of his
life. But men do not strike one another without
provocation. They do not kill one another
without very great provocation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean,&#8221; she said, slowly.
&#8220;You mean that my brother must first have
been the sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not taking that for granted,&#8221; he said,
hastily; &#8220;only one cannot help thinking sometimes
that it might have been so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was my brother,&#8221; she said, simply.
&#8220;He was all that I had in the world. My desire<a class="page" name="Page_161" id="Page_161" title="161"></a>
for justice may be selfish. Yet I hate the man
who killed him, and I want to see him punished.
I do not believe that any sin of his could ever
have deserved so terrible a retribution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; he said; &#8220;yet there is so little
that you can do. To search for any one by
the name of Maltabar around here you have
proved a hopeless task; and that is your only
clue, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sending,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for a London detective.
I shall remain here until he arrives, at
any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again we looked at one another questioningly,
and our silence was like a fresh note of
antagonism to her avowed purpose. She could
not fail to notice it, and she commenced to talk
of other things. I believe but for Mr. Deville&#8217;s
presence she would have got up and left us.
Open war with us women could not have troubled
her in the least. Already I could tell that
she had contracted a dislike to me. But for his
sake she was evidently anxious&mdash;oppressively
anxious&mdash;to keep friendly.</p>

<p>She tried to draw him into more personal
conversation with her, and he seemed quite
ready to humor her. He changed his seat and
sat down by her side. Adelaide Fortress and I
talked listlessly of the Bishop&#8217;s visit and our intending
removal from the neighborhood. We
studiously avoided all mention of my last visit<a class="page" name="Page_162" id="Page_162" title="162"></a>
to her and its sensational ending. We talked
as ordinary acquaintances might have talked,
about trifles. Yet we were both of us equally
conscious that to a certain extent it was a farce.
Presently there was a brief silence. The girl
was talking to Mr. Deville, evidently of her
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was so fond of collecting old furniture,&#8221;
she was saying. &#8220;So am I. He gave me a little
cabinet, the image of this one, only mine
was in black oak.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent over a little piece of furniture by
her side, and looked at it with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine was exactly this shape,&#8221; she continued;
&#8220;only it had a wonderful secret spring.
You pressed it just here and the top flew up,
and there was space enough for a deed or a photograph.&#8221;</p>

<p>She touched a portion of the woodwork idly
as she spoke, and there was a sort of click.
Then she sprang to her feet with a little tremulous
cry.</p>

<p>A portion of the back of the cabinet had
rolled back at the touch of her fingers. A
cabinet photograph was disclosed in the niche.
She was bending over it with pale cheeks and
bloodless lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I cried, with a sudden pain at
my heart. &#8220;What have you found there?&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_163" id="Page_163" title="163"></a></p>

<p>She turned around and faced Adelaide Fortress.
Her eyes were flashing fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all deceiving me,&#8221; she cried, passionately.
&#8220;I was beginning to suspect it. Now
I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>She pointed to the photograph with trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have all declared that the name of Maltabar
is strange to you. It is a lie! That is
the likeness of the man I seek. It is the likeness
of Philip Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="section-break" />
<div class="section"></div>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_164" id="Page_164" title="164"></a></p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="chap">&#8220;IT WAS MY FATHER&#8221;</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two women were standing face to face.
Bruce Deville and I had fallen back. There
was a moment or two&#8217;s breathless silence. Then
Adelaide Fortress, with perfect composure,
moved over to the girl&#8217;s side, and glanced over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, quietly, &#8220;is the photograph
of a man who has been dead twenty years. His
name was not Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; repeated the girl, unshaken, &#8220;is the
photograph of Philip Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stepped forward to look at it, but, as if divining
my purpose, Adelaide Fortress touched
the spring and the aperture was hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;That photograph,&#8221; she repeated, coldly, &#8220;is
the likeness of an old and dear friend of mine
who is dead. I do not feel called upon to tell
you his name. It was not Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe you,&#8221; she said, steadily. &#8220;I
believe that you are all in a conspiracy against
me. I am sorry I ever told you my story. I
am sorry I ever sat down under your roof. I<a class="page" name="Page_165" id="Page_165" title="165"></a>
believe that Philip Maltabar lives and that he is
not far away. We shall see!&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved to the door. Mr. Deville stood
there ready to open it. She looked up at him&mdash;as
a woman can look sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You at least are not against me,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Say that you are not! Say that you
will be my friend once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down and said something to her
very quietly, which we did not hear, and when
she left the room he followed her. We heard
the hall door slam. Through the window we
could see them walking down the gravel path
side by side. She was talking eagerly, flashing
quick little glances up at him, and her fingers
lay upon his coat sleeve. He was listening
gravely with downcast head.</p>

<p>Adelaide Fortress looked from them to
me with a peculiar smile. What she said
seemed a little irrelevant.</p>

<p>&#8220;How she will bore him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I answered, with an
irritation whose virulence surprised me. &#8220;Men
like that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Mr. Deville,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He will hate
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not sure about it. I watched them
disappear. He was stooping down so as to
catch every word she said. Obviously he was
doing his best to adapt himself and to be prop<a class="page" name="Page_166" id="Page_166" title="166"></a>erly
sympathetic. I was angry with myself and
ignorant of the cause of my anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about them,&#8221; I said, abruptly.
&#8220;There is something else&mdash;more important&mdash;Mrs.
Fortress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see that photograph&mdash;the photograph
of the man whom she called Philip Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. Was it my fancy, or
was she indeed a shade paler?</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me that,&#8221; she said, slowly. &#8220;I
would rather not show it to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have asked you, and I ask again!&#8221; I
exclaimed. &#8220;There are already too many
things around me which I do not understand.
I am not a child, and I am weary of all this
mystery. I insist upon seeing that photograph.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her hands upon my shoulders, and
looked up into my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; she said, slowly, &#8220;it were better for
you not to see that photograph. Can&#8217;t you believe
me when I tell you so. It will be better
for you and better for all of us. Don&#8217;t ask me
to show it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would take you at your word,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;only I have already some idea. I caught a
fugitive glimpse of it just now, before you<a class="page" name="Page_167" id="Page_167" title="167"></a>
touched the spring. To know even the worst
is better than to be continually dreading it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed the room in silence, and bending
over the cabinet touched the spring. The
picture smiled out upon me. It was the likeness
of a young man&mdash;gay, supercilious, debonair&mdash;yet
I knew it&mdash;knew it at once. The forehead
and the mouth, even the pose of the head
was unchanged. It was my father.</p>

<p>&#8220;He called himself once, then, Philip Maltabar?&#8221;
I cried, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for him the girl is searching. It is he
who was her brother&#8217;s enemy; it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She held my hand and looked around her
fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; she said, softly. &#8220;The girl may
have returned. It is not a thing to be even
whispered about. Be silent, and keep your own
counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I covered my face with my hands, and
my throat was choked with hard, dry sobs. The
thing which I had most feared had come to
pass. The scene in the church rose up again
before my eyes. I saw the fierce gestures of a
dying man, the froth on his lips, as he struggled
with the words of denunciation, the partial utterance
of which had killed him. With a little<a class="page" name="Page_168" id="Page_168" title="168"></a>
shiver I recognized how narrow had been my
father&#8217;s escape. For I could no longer have
any real doubts. It was my father who had
killed Stephen Berdenstein.</p>

<hr class="section-break" />
<div class="section"></div>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="chap">A CONFERENCE OR TWO</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the wood half-way between the Yellow
House and home I met Bruce Deville. I should
have hurried on, but it was impossible to pass
him. He had a way of standing which took up
the whole path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ffolliot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;may I walk home
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only a few steps,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Please
don&#8217;t trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a pleasure,&#8221; he said, sturdily.</p>

<p>I looked at him; such a faint, acrimonious
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been almost polite enough for
one day?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He seemed to be genuinely surprised at my
ill-humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, I suppose, because I walked
home with that girl,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I did so
on your account only. I wanted to know what
she was going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not require any explanation,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_170" id="Page_170" title="170"></a></p>

<p>He seemed perplexed. Men are such idiots.
In the end he ignored my speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see you,&#8221; he began, thoughtfully.
&#8220;I have been to call at the Vicarage;
your sister would not let me see your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not surprised at that,&#8221; I answered;
&#8220;you do not realize how ill he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had a doctor to see him?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he will not let me send for one,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;Yet I know he is in need of medical
advice. It is very hard to know what to do
for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may advise you,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;I
should strongly recommend your doing exactly
as your father wishes. He knows best
what is well for him. Only tell him this from
me. Tell him that change will be his best medicine.
I heard yesterday that the Bishop wished
him to go to Eastminster at once. Let him get
an invalid carriage and go there to-morrow. It
will be better for him and safer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped short, and laid my hand upon his
wrist. I tried to make him look at me; but he
kept his face turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not thinking of his health only,&#8221; I
said; &#8220;there is something else. I know a good
deal, you need not fear. You can speak openly.
It is that girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not deny it. He looked down at me,<a class="page" name="Page_171" id="Page_171" title="171"></a>
and his strong, harsh face was softened in a
peculiar manner. I knew that he was very sorry
for me, and there was a lump in my throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is she going to do?&#8221; I asked, trembling.
&#8220;What does she suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing definite,&#8221; he answered, quickly.
&#8220;She is bewildered. She is going to stay here
and watch. I am afraid that she will send for
a detective. It is not that she has any suspicion
as to your father. It is you whom she distrusts&mdash;you
and Adelaide. She thinks that you are
trying to keep your father from her. She
thinks that he could tell her&mdash;what she wants
to know. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite enough!&#8221; I cried, passionately.
&#8220;If only we could get her to go away. I am
afraid of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were standing by the gate, I held out my
hand to him; he grasped it warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember my advice to your father,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I shall do my utmost to prevent the girl
from taking any extreme measures. Fortunately
she considers herself under some obligation
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved her life,&#8221; I remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sorry for it,&#8221; he added, curtly.
&#8220;Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away and I hurried into the house.
Alice was nowhere about. I went softly into<a class="page" name="Page_172" id="Page_172" title="172"></a>
my father&#8217;s room. He was dozing, and as I
stood over him and saw how pale and thin his
face was, my heart grew sick and sorrowful.
The tears stood in my eyes. After all, it was
a noble face; I longed to have that barrier
broken down between us, to hear the truth
from his own lips, and declare myself boldly on
his side&mdash;even if it were the side of the outlaw
and the sinner. As I stood there, he opened
his eyes. They were dull and glazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill, father,&#8221; I said, softly, &#8220;you will
get worse if you will not have advice. Let me
go and bring the doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do no such thing,&#8221; he answered,
firmly. &#8220;I am better&mdash;much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not look it,&#8221; I answered, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, I am better, I feel stronger.
Where is that girl? Has she gone away?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was glad he asked me the question outright.
It was one step forward towards the more complete
confidence which I so greatly desired. I
shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she has not gone away. She seems to
have no idea of going. She has found a friend
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she has met Mr. Deville before. He
saved her life in Switzerland.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_173" id="Page_173" title="173"></a></p>

<p>He tossed about for a moment or two with
closed eyes and frowning face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen her again, then?&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I met her this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated. I had not wished to mention my
visit to Adelaide Fortress, at any rate until he
was stronger; but he saw my reluctance and
forced me to answer him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Yellow House,&#8221; I said, softly.</p>

<p>He gave a little gasp. At first I was afraid
that he was going to be angry with me. As it
chanced, the fact of my disobedience did not
seem to occur to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yellow House?&#8221; he repeated, quickly.
&#8220;What was she doing there? What did she
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what excuse she made for calling,&#8221;
I answered. &#8220;She seems to be going
round the neighborhood making inquiries for
Philip Maltabar. She has quite made up her
mind that he is the man who killed her brother.
She says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she is quite sure that he is here&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in
hiding. She is like a ferret, she
will not rest until she has found him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck the bedclothes vigorously with his
white, clenched hand.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_174" id="Page_174" title="174"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;It is false! She will never find him. Philip
Maltabar is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that we could make her believe it,&#8221;
I answered. &#8220;But we cannot. We shall never
be able to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it is not true. Philip Maltabar is
not dead. She knows it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he said hoarsely, raising
himself from the pillows. &#8220;Who says that
he is not dead? Who dares to say that Philip
Maltabar still lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; I answered, firmly. &#8220;It is you who
have called yourself Philip Maltabar in days
that have gone by. It is you for whom she is
looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not attempt to deny it. I had spoken
decisively, with the air of one who knows. He
fell back and half closed his eyes. &#8220;Does she
suspect it?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Is that why she
waited? Is that why she came here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think so,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Yet she
certainly does believe that Philip Maltabar is
somewhere here in hiding. She suspects me
more than any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&mdash;how you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has an idea that he is a friend of mine&mdash;that
I am shielding him and trying to keep
you away from her, lest she should learn the<a class="page" name="Page_175" id="Page_175" title="175"></a>
truth from you. That is what she thinks at
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you persuade her that there is no
such person round here as Philip Maltabar?&#8221;
he murmured. &#8220;She can make her own inquiries,
she can consult directories, the police,
the residents. It ought not to be hard to convince
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; I answered, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible! Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she has seen the photograph, in
Adelaide Fortress&#8217;s cabinet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exclamation seemed to come from his
parched, dry lips like a pistol shot. His burning
eyes were fixed upon me incredulously. I
repeated my words.</p>

<p>&#8220;She saw his photograph at the Yellow
House. It was in the secret aperture of a cabinet.
She touched the spring unwittingly, and
it flew open.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father turned over and groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Fate works like this, the end is not
far off,&#8221; he cried, in a broken voice. &#8220;God help
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>I fell on my knees by the bedside, and took
one of his white hands in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have asked you many
questions which you have not answered. This
one you must answer. I will not live here any<a class="page" name="Page_176" id="Page_176" title="176"></a>
longer in ignorance of it. I am your daughter,
and there are some things which I have a right
to know. Tell me why this woman has your
likeness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My likeness!&#8221; he said fiercely. &#8220;Who dares
say that it is my likeness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your likeness, father,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I
saw it, and there can be no mistake. She has
admitted it, but she will tell me nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may happen that you will know some
day,&#8221; he answered, faintly, &#8220;but not from me&mdash;never
from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tightened my clasp upon his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not say that,&#8221; I continued, firmly.
&#8220;There is something binding you three together,
yet keeping you all apart. You and
Bruce Deville and Adelaide Fortress. What
is it? A secret? Some common knowledge of
an unhappy past? I alone am ignorant of it; I
cannot bear it any longer. If you do not tell
me what it is I must go away. I am not a
child&mdash;I will know!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay quite still and looked at me sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a secret,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;but it
is not mine to tell. Have patience, child, and
some day you will understand. Only have patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been patient long enough,&#8221; I an<a class="page" name="Page_177" id="Page_177" title="177"></a>swered,
bitterly. &#8220;I cannot be patient any
longer. If I cannot be trusted with this secret
now, I shall go away; Alice can take my place
here. I have been at home so little, that you
will not miss me. I will go back to Dresden.
I have made up my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught hold of my hands and held them
with burning fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little while,&#8221; he pleaded, looking at me
piteously. &#8220;Stay with me a little while longer.
Very soon you may know, but not yet&mdash;not&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The secret is not mine alone. It is not for
me to tell. Be patient, Kate! For God&#8217;s sake,
be patient!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been patient long enough,&#8221; I murmured.
&#8220;I shall go away. I can do no good
here. I am not even trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little longer,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Be patient a
little longer. It is a terrible burden which has
been placed on my shoulders. Help me to bear
it. Stay with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have Alice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alice is good, but she is not strong. She is
no help&mdash;and some day I may need help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to leave you,&#8221; I cried, with
trembling lips. &#8220;I do not want to go away. I
want to do all I can to help you&mdash;yet&mdash;imagine<a class="page" name="Page_178" id="Page_178" title="178"></a>
yourself in my place! I am groping about in
the dark corners, I want the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at me with a faint, weary smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are like your mother
was. Won&#8217;t you believe that I am helpless?
If you really mean that you will leave me if I
do not tell you, well, you must go. Even if
you go straight to that woman and tell her all
that you know&mdash;even then my lips are sealed.
This secret is not mine to tell. When you do
know, it will not be I who shall tell you. All
I can say is, go if you must, but for God&#8217;s sake
stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>His face was ineffably piteous. I looked at
his worn, anxious face, and my heart grew soft.
A lump rose up in my throat, and my eyes were
dim. I stooped down and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;I will not ask
you any more questions, and I will not leave
whilst you need me&mdash;whilst you are ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>His lips touched mine, and a little sob was
caught in his throat. I looked into his face
through the mist of my blinding tears, and I
wondered. The light on his features was almost
spiritual.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="chap">FRIENDS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the thought first came to me I flung
it away and trampled it under foot, I could almost
have imagined I was going mad. I, jealous!
What an ugly word! I jealous of that
sallow-faced and black-eyed chit, who followed
Bruce Deville about like his shadow, and
seemed in a certain way to have laid claim to
him as her own especial property. And above
all things there was the man. What was Bruce
Deville to me? What could he be to me?
When the thought first crept into my mind I
laughed out aloud; it was a genuine laugh of
derision at first, but when I listened to its
echoes I was frightened. There was something
hard and unnatural about it&mdash;something which
did not in any way suggest mirth. I turned
upon myself with a certain fierceness. I, whose
secret standard of manhood had always been
so lofty, and to whom polish and culture had
always seemed so absolutely essential, to think
for a moment of such a man as Bruce Deville. I
thrust the idea steadily and scornfully away<a class="page" name="Page_180" id="Page_180" title="180"></a>
from me, it was ridiculous&mdash;humiliating. And,
apart from the absurdity of such thoughts in
connection with such a man, the darkness which
had fallen like a sudden cloud upon our lives
was surely great and engrossing enough to outweigh
every other consideration. Only last
night I had made that passionate effort to learn
the truth from my father and failed. Scarcely
an hour ago I had been with him again renewing
his bandages and secretly burning the old
ones&mdash;bearing my part in that little tragedy,
in whose shadows I seemed to walk blindfolded.</p>

<p>It was a dark, windy morning, but I was
too restless to stay in the house. I threw a cape
over my shoulders and walked down the drive
and out into the road, breathing the fresh air
with a curious sense of relief. After the close
atmosphere of the house it was like a strong,
sweet tonic. I clambered up the green bank on
the other side of the way and found myself suddenly
face to face with Bruce Deville.</p>

<p>He started when he saw me, and for a moment
we looked at one another in silence. I
realized then how completely he had changed
in my thoughts during the last few days. I no
longer noticed the untidiness of his dress, or
the superficial roughness of his demeanor. The
firm locking of his fingers around mine in the
greeting which passed between us was some<a class="page" name="Page_181" id="Page_181" title="181"></a>how
grateful to me. His brown eyes seemed
soft and kindly, the harsh, cynical outlines of
his features were all relaxed.</p>

<p>In silence he turned round and walked
slowly by my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your friend this morning?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>His face grew moody.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has taken some rooms at Grant&#8217;s farm,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;She has gone over to the station
now to get her luggage.&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart sank. It was bad news.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to stay here, then?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to feel flattered, at any rate,&#8221; I
remarked, maliciously.</p>

<p>He flushed an angry glance at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I beg
your pardon, I ought not to have said that.
Neither,&#8221; he continued, after a moment&#8217;s pause,
&#8220;ought you to have said what you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had stopped short at his first exclamation.
I hesitated and then walked slowly on again.
After all it was my fault.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I ought not,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;At the
same time I am not at all sure that she might
not have given up this quest of hers if only you
had not been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you at all,&#8221; he answered,<a class="page" name="Page_182" id="Page_182" title="182"></a>
firmly. &#8220;She would have given it up, I believe,
if she had not seen that photograph in
Adelaide&#8217;s cabinet. It is that which makes her
to decide to remain here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she any fresh suspicions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;She believes
that you and Adelaide Fortress are in
league together. She believes that you both
know where Philip Maltabar is. She also&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
he continued, very slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;She also seems to have an idea that you are
keeping your father away from her so that she
may not have an opportunity of asking him
about Philip Maltabar. She has written to him,
as you know, and the answer came back in a
lady&#8217;s handwriting. She does not believe that
your father had that letter. She believes that
you intercepted and answered it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is stopping really, then, to see him?&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chiefly, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our eyes met for a moment, but we said
nothing. I looked away through the trees to
the glimmering front of the Yellow House, and
asked him a question softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has not any further suspicion, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, I am sure,&#8221; he answered, confidently.
&#8220;It is you whom she believes to be shielding
the man. She has a strong idea that he is a<a class="page" name="Page_183" id="Page_183" title="183"></a>
friend of yours; strangely enough she seems to
have taken a violent dislike to you too. I believe
that the very fact of that dislike blinds
her a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you as to the dislike. But why
strangely?&#8221;</p>

<p>His firm lips parted a little. He looked at
me with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not appear to me,&#8221; he said, slowly,
&#8220;to be a person to be disliked.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made a mental registration of that remark.
It was the nearest approach to a compliment
he had ever paid me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am infinitely obliged,&#8221; I said. &#8220;At the
same time I think I can understand her dislike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You women are so quick at understanding
one another,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;And men are so slow,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Do you
know I have an idea that if she were to come
here now she would dislike me even more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me without embarrassment,
with a genuine desire for information in his face.
He was evidently puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I laughed outright, and it did me good. He
joined in it without the least idea of what I was
laughing at.</p>

<p>&#8220;You men are so stupid!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;You<a class="page" name="Page_184" id="Page_184" title="184"></a>
either will not or cannot see things which are
as simple as A B C.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit it,&#8221; he answered, good humoredly.
&#8220;But must you go in?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded. We had made a little circuit, and
had reached the road again within a few yards
of our gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am going to make something for my
father. He is really ill, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let your sister do it?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;She looks a great deal more used to that
sort of thing than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;At the same time
you are quite wrong. It is I who am the domestic
one of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked distinctly incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t give one that idea at all,&#8221; he
said, forcibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you shall see,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Some
day we will ask you to luncheon and cook it between
us. I know whose productions you will
prefer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; he answered, fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know my sister,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; he answered, bluntly.</p>

<p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very rude,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. I did not mean to be.
As a rule I detest women almost as much as<a class="page" name="Page_185" id="Page_185" title="185"></a>
they detest me. I do not think that your sister
would interest me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does a great deal of good,&#8221; I said. &#8220;She
is managing the whole parish while my father
is ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt she is very useful in her
way,&#8221; he answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is much better tempered than I am,&#8221; I
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt about that,&#8221; he answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think that she could have bandaged
your dog&#8217;s leg as well as I did,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a sudden new thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the first time I spoke to you,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;It seems a long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One measures time by events,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; he replied, quickly, &#8220;was a great
event. I am not likely to forget it. I shall
never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not such a great event after all as the coming
of the heroine of your romance,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;How interesting it must have been to meet
her again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; he exclaimed, testily.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and turned towards
the house.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_186" id="Page_186" title="186"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You are very rude,&#8221; I declared. &#8220;I am
going in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked into my face and was reassured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish from the bottom of my heart that
she had never come here,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;God
knows I would send her away if I had the
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish that you could,&#8221; I answered,
sadly. &#8220;She is like a bird of ill-omen. She
looks at me out of those big black eyes as if
she hated me. I believe I am getting to be
afraid of her. Do you think that she will really
stay here more than a day or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded his head gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see what responsibility the rescuer of
young maidens in distress incurs,&#8221; I remarked,
spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; he said, looking at me steadily,
&#8220;that I had let that carriage go to the bottom
of the precipice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They would have been killed!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he remarked, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very wicked to think of such a
thing,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only living up to my reputation, then,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;That is what my godmamma
told you about me, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not stay with you a moment longer,&#8221;<a class="page" name="Page_187" id="Page_187" title="187"></a>
I declared, ignoring the latter part of his sentence,
and laying my hand upon the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you&mdash;shake hands before you go?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>I hesitated. His request was gruff and his
tone implied rather a command than a favor.
But I looked up at him, and I saw that he was
in earnest.</p>

<p>So I held out my hand and we parted friends.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="chap">A CORNER OF THE CURTAIN</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A note</span> was brought in to me at luncheon
time, addressed in a bold yet delicate feminine
hand which was already becoming familiar. It
was from Adelaide Fortress, and it consisted of
a single line only&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to me this afternoon?&mdash;A.F.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to see her without any hesitation. She
was sitting alone in her room, and something
in her greeting seemed to denote that she was
not altogether at her ease. Yet she was glad
to see me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, child,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have been
thinking about you all day. I am glad that you
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very cheerful thoughts, then, I am
afraid,&#8221; I remarked, with a certain half-unconscious
sympathy in my tone. For her face was
white and drawn, as though she had spent a
sleepless night and an anxious morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I have been
thinking about you ever since you left me yesterday.
I am sorry for you. I am sorry for all<a class="page" name="Page_189" id="Page_189" title="189"></a>
of us. It was an evil chance that brought that
South American girl here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she born in South America?&#8221; I asked,
with pointless curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I should
think so. She told me that she had spent most
of her life there. A girl who dresses as she does
here, and wears diamonds in the morning, must
have come from some outlandish place. Her
toilette is not for our benefit, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up inquiringly. She continued, with
a slight frown upon her face&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;She follows Bruce Deville about everywhere.
I never saw anything so atrociously
barefaced. If he were her husband she could
not claim more from him. They have just gone
by together now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! this afternoon?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a quarter of an hour ago,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;She was holding his arm, and looking up at
him with her great black eyes every moment.
Bah! such a woman gives one a bad taste in
one&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder that Mr. Deville is not rude to
her,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;He does not seem to be
a man likely to be particularly amiable under
the circumstances. I should not think he
would be very easily annexed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;From his general behavior one would not<a class="page" name="Page_190" id="Page_190" title="190"></a>
put him down as a willing squire of dames,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;but that girl is like a dog fawning
for a bone. She will not let him alone. She
waits about for him. She hates to have him
out of her sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps it is a good thing. It
might take her mind off other things,&#8221; I suggested,
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I too am hoping,&#8221; she admitted.
&#8220;That is why I believe Bruce endures her.
There is one thing only of which I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That she may send for a detective on her
own account. Anything rather than that! The
girl alone I think we might deal with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville must use all his influence. He
must persuade her not to,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>She assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will try. Yet for all her folly, so far as
Bruce is concerned, she is not a perfect idiot.
She knows that he is my friend&mdash;and yours&mdash;and
she is desperately jealous. She will suspect
his advice. She will not accept his bidding
blindly. She is cunning. She will agree with
him, and yet she will have her own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be very firm,&#8221; I said. &#8220;There must
be no detective come here. It would be the
last straw. As it is, the anxiety is terrible
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were silent, and we exchanged quick and<a class="page" name="Page_191" id="Page_191" title="191"></a>
furtive glances. Something in her sad face
moved me almost to tears&mdash;it was strangely
soft, so full of subtle and deep sympathy. Involuntarily
I leaned across and held out my
hands to her. She caught them in hers with a
little passionate gesture. That moment
brought us into a new connection. Henceforth
we were on a different footing.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child!&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;My poor child!
You have a terrible burden upon your young
shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The burden I could bear,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;if
only I had some knowledge of its meaning.
You know, you could tell me if you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>I crossed to her side and fell upon my knees,
taking her hand in mine. She looked away
into the fire and her face was as white as death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; she faltered, with trembling lips.
&#8220;I cannot! Don&#8217;t ask me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but I must!&#8221; I cried, passionately. &#8220;It
cannot hurt me so much to know as it does
not to know. There is a secret between you
and my father. You knew him as Philip Maltabar.
Tell me what manner of man he was.
Tell me why he has changed his name. Tell
me what there was between him and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet at my first words.
She sat down again, now trembling in every
limb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you any of these things,&#8221; she<a class="page" name="Page_192" id="Page_192" title="192"></a>
moaned. &#8220;I am sorry I asked you to come.
Go away! Please go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>But my mind was made up now, and the
sight of her weakness only nerved me on. I
stood up before her white and determined&mdash;brutally
reckless as to her sufferings. I would
know now, though I forced the words from
between her white lips. She was a strong
woman, but she had broken down&mdash;she was at
my mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not go away,&#8221; I said, doggedly. &#8220;You
sent for me, and I am here. I will not go away
until you have told me everything. I have a
right to know, and I will know! You shall tell
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw her arms out towards me with a
gesture half pathetic, half imploring. But I
made no movement&mdash;my face was hard, and I
had set my teeth together. Her hands fell into
her lap. I did not touch them. She looked
moodily into the fire. She sat there with fixed
eyes, like a woman who sees a little drama in
the red coals. My heart beat fast with excitement.
I knew that in the war of our wills I
had conquered. She was at my mercy. I was
going to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; she said, slowly, and her voice
seemed to belong to another woman, and to
come from a great distance, &#8220;I will tell you a
story. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_193" id="Page_193" title="193"></a></p>

<p>I leaned over towards her holding my breath.
Now at last, then, I was to know. Yet even in
those moments of intense excitement the outline
of her face, with its curious white torpor,
oppressed me. A chill fear crept into my
blood.</p>

<p>She began.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a girl, well educated, well bred,
and clever. She was an orphan, and early in
life it became necessary for her to earn her
own living. There were several things which
she could do a little, but only one well. She
could write. So she became a journalist.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an odd life for her, but for a time
she was happy. She herself was possessed of
original ideas. She was brought into touch
and sympathy with the modern schools of
thought and manners. She was admitted into
a brilliant little coterie of artists and literary
men and women whose views were daringly
advanced, and who prided themselves in living
up to all they professed. She herself developed
opinions. I will not dwell upon them; I will
only tell you in what they ended. She set herself
against the marriage laws. At first she
was very strong and very bitter. The majority
of men she hated for their cruelty to her sex.
The thought of marriage disgusted her. Any
ceremony in connection with it she looked upon
as a farce. She had no religion in the ordinary<a class="page" name="Page_194" id="Page_194" title="194"></a>
sense of the word. She was brave and daring
and confident. This was all before she knew
what love was.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence, but I did not move my
eyes from her face. Was she waiting for a
word of encouragement from me, I wondered?
If so, the silence must last forever, for I was
tongue-tied. She had created an atmosphere
around her, and I could scarcely breathe. Presently
she went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man came in time, of course. He was
young, ardent, an enthusiast, fresh from college,
with his feet on the threshold of life and
eager for the struggle. He had a little money,
and he was hesitating as to a profession. The
girl was utterly free&mdash;she was her own mistress
in every sense of the word. There was no constraint
upon her movements, no conventionalities
to observe, no one who could exercise over
her even the slightest authority. The young
man proposed marriage. The girl hesitated for
a long while. Old ideas do not easily die, and
she saw clearly, although not clearly enough,
that if she sacrificed them to these new opinions
of hers she must suffer, as the pioneer of all
great social changes must always suffer. Imperial
dynasties and whole empires have been
overthrown in a single day, but generations go
to the changing of a single social law. Yet she
told herself that if she were false to these<a class="page" name="Page_195" id="Page_195" title="195"></a>
tenets, which she had openly embraced and so
often avowed, she must lose forever her own
self-esteem. The eyes of that little band of fellow-thinkers
were upon her. It was a glorious
opportunity. It was only for her to lead and
many others would follow. She felt herself in
a sense the apostle of those new doctrines in
whose truth and purity she was a professed believer.
That was how it all seemed to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told the man what her decision was.
To do him justice, he combated her resolve
fiercely. They parted, but it was only for a
while. In such a struggle victory must rest
with the woman. This was no exception to the
general rule. The woman triumphed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their after history is not pleasant telling.
The woman and the man were utterly unsuited
for each other. The man was an enthusiast, almost
a fanatic; the woman was cold, calculating,
and matter of fact. The man suddenly determined
to enter the Church. The woman
was something between a pantheist and an
agnostic with a fixed contempt of all creeds.
The inevitable came to pass. She followed out
the logical sequence of her new principles, and
left the man for another.&#8221;</p>

<p>I suppose my face expressed a certain horror.
How could I help it? I shrank a little back,
and my eyes sought her, doubtfully. She<a class="page" name="Page_196" id="Page_196" title="196"></a>
turned upon me with a shade of fierceness on
her white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a swift judge!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It
is the young always who are cruel! It is the
young always who have no mercy!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was shocked at the agony which seemed
to have laid hold of her. That slight instinct
of repulsion of which she had been so quick to
notice the external signs in my face, seemed
to have cut her like a knife. I moved swiftly
to her side and dropped on my knees by her.
I was ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me!&#8221; I pleaded, softly. &#8220;I am very
ignorant. I believe that the woman did what
seemed right to her. I was wrong to judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent her head. I took her fingers softly
into mine. &#8220;You were that woman,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>She looked at me and half rose from her
chair, pushing me away from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was that woman,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;Your
father was the man! You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I cried out, but she would not be interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; she added, wildly, &#8220;are my child&mdash;and
his!&#8221;</p>

<span class="chap">I AM THE VICTIM</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I rose</span> to my feet and stood apart from her.
For a moment it was like the end of the world&mdash;like
the end of all sensation. I was trembling
in every limb. I believe that I gasped for
breath. She sat and looked at me. When I
spoke my voice seemed to come from a long
distance. I did not recognize it. My sense of
my own identity seemed confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the victim, then&mdash;the unhappy victim
of your miserable theories!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are&mdash;oh! my God!&mdash;you are the
weak spot in a faith of which I was once an
ardent disciple,&#8221; she said, quietly. &#8220;You made
all the difference. When you came I knew that
I had sinned. All my arguments seemed suddenly
weak and impotent when I strove to
bring them to bear upon the face of your existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have married him&mdash;at once,&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too late,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;He had
separated himself from me forever by entering<a class="page" name="Page_198" id="Page_198" title="198"></a>
a profession which I despised. He had entered
the Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>A horrible thought flashed into my mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other man,&#8221; I whispered, with burning
cheeks, for she was my mother.</p>

<p>She pointed out of the window&mdash;pointed
along that narrow, hateful path which threaded
the plantation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;He died&mdash;there!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time my sense of horror was almost
numbed. I could speak almost calmly. I felt
as though I was standing on the world&#8217;s edge.
Nothing more mattered. The end had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father killed him,&#8221; I said, almost calmly.</p>

<p>She looked away from me and fixed her eyes
upon a particular spot in the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask no questions, child,&#8221; she said, sadly.
&#8220;You know enough now. There were some
things which it were wiser for you not to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; I cried, bitterly. &#8220;I have
learned enough for one afternoon&mdash;I have
learned enough to make me miserable forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman covered her face with her hands.
It were as though a spasm of inward pain had
distorted her features. She was suffering terribly.
Yet at that time I had no thoughts of
any pity. I was merciless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have learned what has given you pain<a class="page" name="Page_199" id="Page_199" title="199"></a>
to hear, and what has given me much pain to
confess,&#8221; she said, slowly. &#8220;Confess,&#8221; she repeated,
slowly, and with unutterable bitterness.
&#8220;That is a hateful word. I never foresaw the
time when I should have to use it&mdash;to my own
daughter! When one is young one is proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were short-sighted,&#8221; I said, brutally.</p>

<p>Again she bowed her head and suffered. But
what did I care? I was no heroine, and I never
laid any claim to gentleness of disposition or
great unselfishness. I was simply an ordinary
human being, confronted with a great humiliation.
My heart was closed to hers. The wrong
to myself seemed to loom above everything
else. The interruption that was at hand was
perhaps merciful. I might have said things
which afterwards I should have blushed to have
remembered. But at that moment there came
a sound of voices in the hall. Bruce Deville was
there and Miss Berdenstein.</p>

<p>We both rose up. Her coming was a surprise
to us. She entered by his side in some
embarrassment. Mr. Deville proceeded to explain
her presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Miss Berdenstein here, and persuaded
her to come in with me,&#8221; he said, in a brusque,
matter of fact tone. &#8220;I took the liberty of assuring
her that you would be glad to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did quite right,&#8221; Adelaide Fortress
said, calmly. &#8220;I am very glad to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_200" id="Page_200" title="200"></a></p>

<p>She greeted the girl kindly, but in a subdued
manner. As for me, I shook hands with her
coldly and under protest. I was very much
surprised that she should have come here, even
at the instigation of Bruce Deville.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we are not too late for tea,&#8221; he remarked,
glancing around the room.</p>

<p>Adelaide Fortress rang the bell. I smiled
faintly at a certain irony in the thought called
up by his question. I had shaken hands with
the girl unwillingly. We were to be enemies. I
was sure of that, and I preferred open warfare.</p>

<p>Tea was brought in, and a little general conversation
was started, in which I took no part.
Presently he came over to my side. The other
two were talking, the girl was relating some of
her South American experiences to Adelaide
Fortress, who was leaning back amongst the
shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you bring her here,&#8221; I asked,
softly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It is better to be on friendly
terms with her. We know then what she is
going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you appear to think,&#8221; I remarked, with
some emphasis. &#8220;You seem to be progressing
wonderfully. I congratulate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed in my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she is not at all uninteresting,&#8221; he de<a class="page" name="Page_201" id="Page_201" title="201"></a>clared.
&#8220;If you had seen as much of her as I
have the last few days you would find her enchanting.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her contemplatively. Her little
person was almost lost in a huge sealskin coat,
and her ungloved hands were blazing with diamonds.
As she talked her white teeth (she had
beautiful teeth) gleamed, and her black eyes
flashed in their sallow setting. She was an odd-looking
creature. Every now and then she
darted swift, anxious glances towards us, once
she paused and made a strenuous effort to overhear
what we were saying. She need not have
troubled herself. I barely heard what Bruce
Deville was saying to me; my answers to him
were purely mechanical. I was scarcely conscious
whether it was indeed I who was sitting
there within a few yards of that pale-faced, composed
woman from whose lips only a few minutes
ago I had heard that story which seemed
to me yet like a dark, shadowy nightmare. The
echoes of her passionate words seemed still lingering
around the dimly lit room. Once or
twice I raised my hand to my temples&mdash;my
head was reeling. At last I could bear it no
longer. The irony of small talk was too bitter.
A sense of suffocation came over me. I rose to
my feet and made my excuses.</p>

<p>Scarcely a word passed between the woman
whom I had learned to know as Adelaide For<a class="page" name="Page_202" id="Page_202" title="202"></a>tress
and myself. I touched her fingers, and
they were as cold as ice. Then, with a single
look at her dark eyes, I left the room.</p>

<p>Bruce Deville followed me out. The girl too
had sprung up, and was making her hasty
adieux. Before she could leave the room, however,
Bruce Deville had reached my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming home with you, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221;
he said, in my ear.</p>

<p>I did not answer him. We were half-way
down the path when Miss Berdenstein&#8217;s shrill
voice reached us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Involuntarily I stopped too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will take me home, Mr. Deville, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t possibly find the
way by myself; and, besides, I should be terrified
to death. It is so dark. I should not
have dreamed of staying so late if I had been
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He muttered something profane under his
breath. I started to walk on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you be here when I come back,&#8221; he
inquired, brusquely. &#8220;I was only going a few
steps with Miss Ffolliot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite ready to start now,&#8221; she answered;
&#8220;and I have said goodbye to Mrs. Fortress.
I really don&#8217;t see how I can stay any
longer; and I dare not go a step alone. It is<a class="page" name="Page_203" id="Page_203" title="203"></a>
almost pitch dark. Shall I walk home with
Miss Ffolliot and you first?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was almost out of hearing when she had
finished, for at the commencement of her
speech I had quickened my pace. When I
clambered up the bank to reach the footpath
I looked behind. They were walking along the
road together&mdash;an oddly assorted couple. His
shoulders were up&mdash;a bad sign&mdash;and he was
taking long strides, to keep up with which she
had almost to run, holding her skirts in both
hands, and picking her way through the mud.
Behind in the doorway of the Yellow House I
saw a woman, pale and motionless, watching
me with wistful, sorrowing eyes. But I turned
my head and hurried away.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="chap">OUT OF DANGER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> straight to my father&#8217;s room, with
only a very confused sense of what I wanted
to say to him floating in my mind. But to my
amazement, when I had softly opened the door
and stood inside the room, he was not upon the
bed, or on the couch. The room was empty. I
passed through into the drawing room with the
same result. Then I retraced my steps down
into the hall and saw that his hat was gone
from the stand and also his overcoat.</p>

<p>I called to Alice, and she came out to me
from our little drawing room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is father?&#8221; I cried, breathlessly. &#8220;He
is not upstairs!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew me into the room. Her round face
was very sober, and her eyes were grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;He left for London a quarter of an hour
ago,&#8221; she declared, impressively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Left for London!&#8221; I repeated, bewildered.
&#8220;Why, he was scarcely well enough to stand.
Did he dress himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was very weak, but he seemed perfectly<a class="page" name="Page_205" id="Page_205" title="205"></a>
well able to take care of himself,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;A telegram came for him about half
an hour ago. I took it up to his room, and he
opened and read it without remark. He asked
where you were, but I could only tell him that
you were out. Directly afterwards I heard him
getting up, and I went to the door of his room
to see if I could help him. He told me that I
was to order the dog cart, and that he was
going away. I was too surprised to say a
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>My first impulse was unmistakable. It was a
sense of great relief. Then I began to wonder
what this Berdenstein girl would think. Would
she connect it with her presence here? Would
she think that he had gone away to avoid her?
There was that risk, but it was no greater than
the risk of her coming here some day and meeting
him face to face. On the whole it was good
news. It was a respite at any rate.</p>

<p>In the morning came a letter from him, dated
simply London. He had been called away, he
said, on some business, the details of which
would not interest us, but it was a call which
it would not have been his duty to have
neglected. Immediately he had concluded it,
he went on to say, he proposed to take a short
vacation by the sea somewhere. Accordingly
he had engaged a <i>locum tenens</i>, who was now
on his way down, and he would write us again<a class="page" name="Page_206" id="Page_206" title="206"></a>
as soon as he had definitely decided where to
go.</p>

<p>Alice and I laid down the letter with varying
thoughts. To her, ignorant of any reasons for
conduct which was on the face of it somewhat
eccentric, it brought some concern. With me
it was different. I was at once relieved and
glad. I had arrived at that acutely nervous
and overwrought state when even a respite is
welcome. The explanations between us were
for the present necessarily postponed, and, at
any rate, I could meet Olive Berdenstein now
without trembling. It was the truth which I
had to tell. My father was not here. I did not
know where he was. She could come and
search for him.</p>

<p>Yet that was a time of fierce disquiet with me.
To settle down to any manner of work seemed
impossible. Later in the day I went out into
the garden, and the cool touch of the soft, damp
wind upon my face tempted me past the line of
trees which hemmed in our little demesne out
into the muddy road and across to the broad
expanse of green common which was really a
part of the Deville home park. As I stood
there, bareheaded, with the wind blowing
through my hair and wrapping my skirts
around me, I could see in the distance a man
coming on horseback from the Court. I stood
still and watched him. There was no mistaking<a class="page" name="Page_207" id="Page_207" title="207"></a>
man or horse&mdash;Bruce Deville on his great
chestnut&mdash;though they were half a mile away.
Then, as I stood there waiting for him, a sudden
darkness came into the faintly sunlit air, a
poisoned darkness&mdash;the poison of a hideous
thought. I turned away and plunged into the
plantation on my left, flying along the narrow
footpath as though the thought had taken to
itself the shape of some loathsome beast and
was indeed pursuing me, close on my heels. In
less than five minutes I was standing breathless
before Adelaide Fortress. She was looking
white and ill. When she came into the room
she threw across at me a glance which was almost
supplicatory. Her firm lips trembled a
little. Her eyes were soft and full of invisible
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it bad news?&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;You have
been running. Sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Another question, that is all. Mr.
Deville?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked puzzled for a moment. Then she
drew herself up and stood a little away from
me. Her firm, dark eyebrows resolved themselves
into a frown. Some subtle instinct, quick
to fly backwards and forwards between us two,
had helped her towards the meaning of my
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bromley Deville, Mr. Deville&#8217;s father,<a class="page" name="Page_208" id="Page_208" title="208"></a>
was my father&#8217;s oldest friend,&#8221; she said, slowly.
&#8220;Bruce and I were children together, and except
that I, of course, was five years the elder,
we were great friends. Mr. Bromley Deville
was my father&#8217;s executor, and since his death
Bruce has taken his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great relief had suddenly eased my heart.
I drew a little breath, but she looked as if I had
struck her a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is your father?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Is there
any news?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is better; he is gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone away? Where to?&#8221; she added,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To London, and from there he is going to
the sea,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;He does not say where.
He is sending a <i>locum tenens</i>. I do not think
that he will return here at all. We want him
to go straight to Eastminster.&#8221;</p>

<p>She too seemed to share my relief, but my
first thoughts were hers too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will that girl say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;she may be suspicious.
At any rate we have a reprieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not spoken&mdash;to him yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he had gone when I returned last night.
I was glad of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood face to face looking at one another<a class="page" name="Page_209" id="Page_209" title="209"></a>
in silence. The faint color was coming and
going in her cheeks, and her hands were nervously
clasping the back of a chair. Where she
stood the few days of wintry sunlight which
had found their way into the room were merciless
to her. They showed up the little streaks
of grey in her hair and the hollows in her
cheeks. The lines of acute and bitter heartpain
were written into her worn face. My
heart grew soft for the first time. She had
suffered. Here was a broken life indeed. Her
dark, weary eyes were raised eagerly to mine,
yet I could not offer her what I knew so well
she desired.</p>

<p>I was forced to speak. Her silence was
charged with eloquent questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you&mdash;give me a little time to realize
what you have told me?&#8221; I said, hesitatingly.
&#8220;I have grown so used to think that Alice&#8217;s
mother was mine&mdash;that she was dead&mdash;that I
cannot realize this all at once. I don&#8217;t want
to be cruel, but one has instincts and feelings,
and one can&#8217;t always control them. I must
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I went away, and in the Vicarage lane I
met Bruce Deville walking towards me with
his horse&#8217;s bridle through his arm. He was
carrying a fragrant bunch of violets, which he
held out a little awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you will care for<a class="page" name="Page_210" id="Page_210" title="210"></a>
these,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about
flowers myself. The gardener told me they
were very fine, so I thought you may as well
have them as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As let them spoil,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;Thank you
very much, Mr. Deville. They are beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned for a moment, and then, meeting
my eye, laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am awfully clumsy,&#8221; he said,
shortly. &#8220;Let me tell you the truth. I went all
through the houses to see if I could find anything
fit to bring you, and I knew you preferred
violets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very nice of you,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but what
about Olive Berdenstein? Doesn&#8217;t she like
violets?&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth, but I held up my hand
and stopped him; he had so much the look of
a man who is about to make a momentary lapse
into profanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything rude, please. Where is
she this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered, grimly. &#8220;Somewhere
about, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be a lesson to you,&#8221; I remarked,
smiling up at him, &#8220;not to go about indulging
in romantic adventures. They generally have
a tiresome ending, you know. Do you always
make such easy conquests, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_211" id="Page_211" title="211"></a></p>

<p>He stopped short, and looked at me with
darkened face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any necessity,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;for you
to go out of your way to irritate and annoy
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I ignored him for a moment or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very rich,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;Have you
seen her diamonds?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rested his hand upon his horse and
sprang into the saddle. From his great height
there he looked down upon me with a dark
frown and angry eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wish you good morning, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;My company is evidently distasteful
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed at him, and laid my hand upon his
horse&#8217;s bridle. &#8220;I can assure you that it isn&#8217;t,&#8221;
I declared. &#8220;I was very glad to see you indeed.
Please get down, you have too much an advantage
of me up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got down at once, but his face had not
altogether cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Miss Ffolliot,&#8221; he said, looking
at me steadfastly out of his keen, grey eyes, &#8220;I
do not wish to have you talk to me in that way
about that young woman. I do not think it is
quite fair. I suppose it is what girls call chaff,
but you will kindly remember that I am too
stupid, if you like, always to know when you
are in earnest and when you are not, so please<a class="page" name="Page_212" id="Page_212" title="212"></a>
don&#8217;t do it. If I am with Miss Berdenstein at
all please remember that it is for your sake. I
hate reminding you of it, but you make me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Please do not think that I am not grateful.
Now let me tell you the news. My father has
gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone away! Where? For how long?&#8221; he
said, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone first to London,&#8221; I answered;
&#8220;where he was going to afterwards he did not
seem absolutely sure himself. He spoke of going
to the sea somewhere for a vacation. We
are trying to arrange for him not to come back
here at all. I should like him to go straight to
Eastminster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great relief,&#8221; he said, promptly; &#8220;it
was the very best thing he could do. He did
not even tell you that he was going then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea of it. He went quite suddenly
while I was out. We had a letter from
him this morning. I wonder&mdash;what she will
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think that she will trouble to go in
search of him,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I do not think
that her suspicions are really aroused in connection
with your father. She is an odd,
changeable sort of girl. I daresay she will give
up this quest before long.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_213" id="Page_213" title="213"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;It would be a
great relief to have her go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence between us. We
were standing by the Vicarage gate, and my
hand was upon the latch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, abruptly, &#8220;whether you
would not walk a little way with me. It is such
a fine day, and you look a little pale.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are riding,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is nothing,&#8221; he answered, briskly.
&#8220;Diana follows me like a lamb. We will walk
along the avenue. I want you to see the elm
trees at the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>We started off at once. There was nothing
very remarkable about that walk, and yet I have
always thought of it as a very memorable one.
It gave a distinct color to certain new ideas of
mine concerning my companion. We talked
all the time, and that morning confirmed my
altering impressions of him. Lady Naselton
had spoken of him as rough and uncultured.
He was neither. His lonely life and curious
brusqueness were really only developed from
mannerism into something more marked by a
phase of that intellectual tiredness which most
men ape but few feel. He had tried life, and it
had disappointed him, but there was a good
deal more of the cosmopolitan than the &#8220;yokel&#8221;
in him.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_214" id="Page_214" title="214"></a></p>

<p>For me it was a delightful time. He talked
of many books and countries which had interested
me with a perfectly bewildering familiarity.
The minutes flew along. I forgot all these
troubles which had come so thick upon me as
we walked side by side over the soft, spongy
turf, sometimes knee deep amongst the
bracken, sometimes skirting clumps of faded
heather. But our walk was not to terminate
altogether without incident. As we turned the
corner, and came again within sight of the
Vicarage gate, we found ourselves face to face
with Olive Berdenstein.</p>

<p>She stopped short when she saw us, and her
face grew dark and angry. She was a strange-looking
figure as she stood there in the middle
of the lane waiting for us&mdash;a little over-dressed
for Sunday morning parade in the Park. For
a country walk her toilette was only laughable.
The white lace of her skirt was soiled, and
bedraggled with mud. One of her little French
shoes had been cut through with a stone, and
when we came in sight she was limping painfully.
Her black eyes flashed upon us with a
wicked fire. Her lips trembled. The look she
darted upon me was full of malice. She was
in a furious temper, and she had not the wit
to hide it. It was to him she spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that you would call for me&mdash;that
we would walk together this morning,&#8221; she said<a class="page" name="Page_215" id="Page_215" title="215"></a>
to him in a low, furious tone. &#8220;I waited for
you one, two hours. Why did you not come?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered her gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that you must be mistaken,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There was no arrangement. You asked me
to call; I said I would if I could. As it happened,
I could not; I had something else to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something else! Oh, yes! so I see,&#8221; she
answered, with a short, hysterical little laugh,
and a glance of positive hatred at me. &#8220;Something
more pleasant! I understand; we shall
see. Miss Ffolliot, you are on your way home
now, I presume. I will, with your very kind
permission, accompany you. I wish to see your
father. I will wait in your house until he can
see me. If you deny me permission to enter,
I will wait for the doctor. He shall tell me
whether your father is not strong enough to
answer me one single question, and if the doctor,
too, be in your plot, and will not answer
me reasonably, I will go to a magistrate at
once. Oh! it will not be difficult. I will go to
a magistrate. You see I am determined. If
you would like to finish your amiable conversation,
I will walk behind&mdash;or in front&mdash;whichever
you like. Better in front, no doubt. Ha!
ha! But I will come; I am determined.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ceased breathless, her eyes on fire, her
lips curled in a malicious smile. It was I on<a class="page" name="Page_216" id="Page_216" title="216"></a>
whom she had vented her passion. It was I
who answered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can come with me to the Vicarage if
you like,&#8221; I said, coldly; &#8220;but you will not find
my father. He has gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone away!&#8221; she repeated, incredulously.
For a moment she looked black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone away! Oh, indeed! That is good;
that is very clever! You have arranged that
very well. Yesterday he was too ill to see me&mdash;to
answer one little question. To-day he is
well enough to travel&mdash;he is gone away. Good!
he has gone. I can follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pursed up her lips and nodded her head
at me vigorously. She was white with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome to do anything which
seems reasonable to you,&#8221; I answered, with at
any rate a show of firmness. &#8220;Mr. Deville, I
will say good afternoon. It is time I was at
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kept by my side with the obvious intention
of seeing me to the gate; but as we passed
the girl she took hold of his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I say no! You shall not leave me like
this! You are treating me shamefully, Mr.
Deville. Am I not right? That girl is hiding
her father from me. She is helping him away
that he may not tell me of the man who killed
my brother! You will take my part; you have
always said that you were sorry for me. Is<a class="page" name="Page_217" id="Page_217" title="217"></a>
every one to be my enemy? You too! It is
justice that I want! That is all!&#8221;?</p>

<p>He threw her delicately gloved hand off
roughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I have been
sorry for you, I am sorry for you now; but
what on earth is the good of persecuting Miss
Ffolliot in this manner? Her father has been
ill, and of course he has not desired to be bothered
by strangers. You say you wanted to ask
him a question. Be reasonable; he has answered
it by letter. If you saw him, he could
only repeat his answer. He has only been here
for a few months. I have lived here all my life,
and I tell you that there is no one by the name
of Maltabar in the county.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was the photograph in that cabinet,&#8221;
she persisted&mdash;&#8220;within a few yards of the spot
where he was killed. I know that Philip Maltabar
hated him. I know that he would have
killed him if he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what has all this to do with Mr. Ffolliot?&#8221;
he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I begged him to see me,&#8221; she urged,
doggedly. &#8220;He is the clergyman of the parish,
and he certainly ought to have seen me if I
wished it. I don&#8217;t understand why he should
not. I want advice; and there are other things
I wanted to see him about. I am sure that he
was kept away from me.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_218" id="Page_218" title="218"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You are very silly indeed,&#8221; Bruce Deville
said, emphatically. &#8220;Surely his health was
more important than the answering a question
for you which has already been answered by
people in a much better position to know. As
to advice, mine has always been at your service.
I have been ready to do anything for you in
reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very good,&#8221; she said, with
trembling lips, &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me now,&#8221; he interrupted,
&#8220;I have something to say to Miss Ffolliot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going in,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Please do
not come any further. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded to him, the girl I ignored. If a
glance could have killed me, I should have been
a dead woman. I left them alone and went on
up to the house. Somehow I did not envy her
Mr. Deville&#8217;s society for the next quarter of an
hour.</p>

<hr class="section-break" />
<div class="section"></div>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_219" id="Page_219" title="219"></a></p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="chap">AN UNHOLY COMPACT</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> may easily be imagined I had seen quite
enough of Olive Berdenstein for one day at
any rate, if not for a long time to come. But
to my surprise, on that same afternoon, as I
sat in our little drawing room pretending to
read a stupid novel, there was a timid ring
at the bell, and she was shown into the room.
She entered nervously, as though uncertain as
to how I should receive her. I daresay she
would not have been at all surprised if I had
ordered her out again. If I had followed my
first impulse I should certainly have done so.
Wiser counsels prevailed, however, and although
I did not offer her my hand, I suppressed
my surprise at her coming, and motioned
her to take a seat.</p>

<p>She was dressed much more quietly than I
had yet seen her, in a plain brown dress, beautifully
made. The element of incongruity was
still there, however, for she wore a large Paris
hat, and the little lace scarf at her throat was
fastened with a great diamond.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_220" id="Page_220" title="220"></a></p>

<p>She sat quite still, and I could see that she
was very nervous. She kept her eyes away
from my face as much as possible. When she
began to talk she did so rapidly, and in a low
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are very surprised to see me,
Miss Ffolliot, after this morning,&#8221; she commenced,
tentatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only made up my mind to come an hour
ago. It was a sudden impulse. I started at
once, or I should have changed my mind. I
have come to make you an offer. It will sound
very oddly to you, but you must not be angry.
You must hear all that I have to say. I have
thought it all out; it is very reasonable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be afraid,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I
shall certainly not mind listening&mdash;so long as
you do not talk as you were talking this morning.
I am quite willing to forget that if you
do not remind me of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fixed her black eyes upon me intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ffolliot, have you ever loved any one&mdash;a
man, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not help starting, the question was
so unexpected. She was watching me very
keenly. Perhaps my color was not altogether
steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so&mdash;not in the way you mean,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_221" id="Page_221" title="221"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I will make it clear. I do love some one. I
did not think that you would, you are too cold,
you look too proud. Now I want to tell you.
There is some one whom I love desperately&mdash;with
my whole life. I want to tell you about it.
Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; I answered, softly. The
change in her was wonderful. Her eyes were
as soft as velvet; there was a faint flush in her
cheeks. But for those prominent teeth and the
sharp outlines of her features she was almost
beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember, I have told you of our accident
in Switzerland, and of Mr. Deville, and
how gloriously he saved us. Oh, it was wonderful!
Even now when I think of it I feel excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed my head slowly. I began to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ever since that moment I have loved
him,&#8221; she said, simply. &#8220;I could not get him
out of my mind. Oh! it was magnificent to
see him struggling there for our lives with
those fierce, strong horses, beating them back,
mastering them little by little, and all the time
quite cool and silent! But you have heard all
about that, you do not want to hear the story
again. Since that day I have never been able
to think of any other man. I have had many
offers, for I am rich, but I only laughed. The<a class="page" name="Page_222" id="Page_222" title="222"></a>
idea of marriage when he was in the world
seemed wicked to me. It was because of him
that I did not go back to South America. It
was because he was an Englishman that I kept
on coming to England and looking for him in
all those places where Englishmen are mostly
to be found. I have never missed a season in
London since, and yet I do not care for London.
It was just because of the chance of finding
him there. It is three years ago now, but
I have never despaired. I think that I must be
something of a fatalist. I have said to myself
that in the end we must meet again, and now
you see although we have been living in this
out-of-the-way spot, the time has come. There
is something wonderful about it. Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>I bowed my head. The eagerness of her
question demanded an affirmative.</p>

<p>She sighed, softly, with an air of gentle satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I tell myself,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;It is wonderful. It must have been fate. I
tell myself that, and it seems to me that fate
which has brought us together could not now
be so cruel as to interfere between us. And I
love him, I love him so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused a moment and looked at me almost
with pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; she said, thoughtfully&mdash;&#8220;you will<a class="page" name="Page_223" id="Page_223" title="223"></a>
never know the misery of it&mdash;or the happiness!&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled faintly, and without mirth. Poor
girl! There was something terribly pathetic
in her little confession. From the bottom of
my heart I pitied her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Deville?&#8221; I asked, softly.</p>

<p>Her face fell a little. The enthusiasm died
away. Still she was hopeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; she said, looking away from
me into the fire. &#8220;He is kind to me, and I
think that he likes me&mdash;a little. He does not
care for me as I do for him, of course,&#8221; she
added, sadly. &#8220;Why should he? I have done
nothing for him, and he has done so much for
me. It has been all on one side. I have had
no chance yet; but I could help him a little. I
am rich, very much richer than any one thinks,
and they say that, although he has a great
house and lands, that he is very poor, and that
he has heavy debts. I could pay them all off,&#8221;
she declared, with a little note of triumph in
her tone. &#8220;I have what would come in English
money to nearly a million pounds. I should
give it all to him, every penny. It would make
him happy to pay off all his mortgages and old
debts. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221; she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay it might,&#8221; I answered, gravely. &#8220;I
should think it certainly would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I love him so,&#8221; she repeated, softly.<a class="page" name="Page_224" id="Page_224" title="224"></a>
&#8220;It would be such happiness to do this for him.
Perhaps he would not love me very much just
yet, but when I had him all to myself it would
come little by little. I could make it come; a
woman can when she has a man all to herself.
I am sure of it. I should have no fear at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were very soft now and very bright.
One forgot her sharp features and sallow
cheeks. Poor girl! Then suddenly she looked
away from the fire, and, rising, came over to
my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wondering why I have come to you
to tell you my secret,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will tell
you. I am afraid of you. You are so handsome,
and I am plain. Oh! yes, I am&mdash;I know
it. Never mind, I love him. But he does not
know that, and he admires you. I see him look
at you, and though he is kind to me, he does
not look at me like that. And you&mdash;you do
not care for him. I have watched you, and I
am sure of it. You do not want him, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not want him,&#8221; I answered, but
without looking at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t. I want to promise you
something. I believe that Philip Maltabar is
somewhere in this neighborhood, and I believe&mdash;no,
I am sure&mdash;that in some way you are interested
in him. Your father knows. That is
why you have kept me from him. But never
mind, I want to forget all that if you will just<a class="page" name="Page_225" id="Page_225" title="225"></a>
help me a little. I shall go away from here,
presently. If I should come back again, and I
should find Philip Maltabar&mdash;well&mdash;never mind.
I will forgive, and I will forget. God shall judge
between those two&mdash;I will bury my desire for
vengeance. This I swear&mdash;if you will help me
a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; I asked, blandly. &#8220;What can I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can help me simply by keeping away
from Mr. Deville,&#8221; she went on, hastily, a certain
bluntness creeping into the manner of her
expression as she reached the heart of her subject.
&#8220;If you are not there, then he will be content
with me, I can talk to him. I can make
him understand by degrees. There! I suppose
you think this is very unwomanly of me. It is
unwomanly, it is despicable. I should detest
another woman who did it. But I don&#8217;t care&mdash;I
want him so much. I love him better than
life,&#8221; she cried, with a little burst of passion.
&#8220;I shall die if he does not care for me&mdash;not as
I care for him, of course, but just a little&mdash;and
more afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>I leaned over and rested my hand upon hers.
I felt a sudden kindness toward her. I don&#8217;t
know what instinct made me promise&mdash;I suppose
it was pity. There was something so pathetic
in her intense earnestness.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_226" id="Page_226" title="226"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will do what you wish,&#8221; I said, softly;
&#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what? Are you making conditions?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make no conditions. Only I wanted to
say this to you. Do you think it is wise to let
yourself care so much for any one who after all
may not care for you at all? It is like staking
one&#8217;s whole happiness upon a chance. It is a
terrible risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at me faintly, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is so easy to see that you
have never loved&mdash;that you do not know what
love is. When you do you will not talk about
letting one&#8217;s self care. You might as well talk
about letting one&#8217;s self die when one is struggling
upon a death bed panting and gasping
for life. It is the inevitable in love as in death.
There is no choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall not trouble
you any more. I am going to forget that such
a person as Philip Maltabar ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked with her to the door. She looked
down the dim road up the park wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I may see him this afternoon.
Was he coming to see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. He does not visit here,&#8221; I
continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he comes to see me,&#8221; she said, quickly.<a class="page" name="Page_227" id="Page_227" title="227"></a>
&#8220;Perhaps it is not right&mdash;proper you call it&mdash;that
he should. I do not care. I would like
you to come and visit me&mdash;but&mdash;he might be
there,&#8221; she added, hesitatingly. &#8220;Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>I touched her hand, and she went out with
a little flush still lingering in her cheeks. I
saw her look wistfully up and down the road,
and then she picked up her skirts and took the
muddy footpath across the park towards the
Court. I turned away and went upstairs to my
room.</p>

<p>Was it pity for her I wonder that brought
the tears into my eyes? After all, I was only a
woman.</p>

<span class="chap">IN THE PLANTATION</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> determined to keep my word with
Olive Berdenstein with absolute faithfulness.
For nearly a week I stayed in the house except
for a short walk in the early morning. Three
times Bruce Deville called, and met with the
same answer. Often I saw him riding slowly
by and scanning the garden and looking up towards
the house with an impatient look in his
eyes and a dark frown upon his strong face.
Once I saw him walking with Olive Berdenstein.
She seemed to have caught him up, and
found him in no very pleasant temper. His
shoulders were high, and he was walking so
quickly that she had almost to run to keep up
with him. I looked away with a sigh, and yet&mdash;what
a heartless hypocrite I was. I found
myself thinking with a curious satisfaction that
his shoulders had been lower and his face very
different when I had walked with him.</p>

<p>After nearly a week of solitude with only
Alice&#8217;s parish talk and mild speculations as to
our future at Eastminster to break the intoler<a class="page" name="Page_229" id="Page_229" title="229"></a>able
monotony of it, I could bear it no longer.
I put on my hat one wet and windy afternoon
and went down to the Yellow House. Adelaide
Fortress was alone, writing at her desk,
and when I entered we looked at one another
for a moment without any greeting. It seemed
to me that a few more grey hairs had mingled
with the black&mdash;a little more wanness had crept
into the delicate, intellectual face. But she
greeted me cheerfully, without any shadow of
reproach in her tone, although I knew that my
absence had been a trouble to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good of you to come and see me,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Have you heard from your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard on Wednesday. He was leaving
London that afternoon for the South Coast.
He wrote very cheerfully, and said he felt better
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>

<p>Then we were silent for a few moments.
There was so much that we could both have
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville has been here inquiring for
you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have been invisible, he
said. Have you been unwell?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. I wanted much to have
told her of Olive Berdenstein&#8217;s visit to me, and
of my compact with her. For a moment I hesi<a class="page" name="Page_230" id="Page_230" title="230"></a>tated.
She noticed it, and doubtless drew her
own conclusions.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been nothing particular to keep
me in,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I simply felt that I wished to
see no one. Don&#8217;t you feel like that sometimes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very often,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;I think the desire
for solitude is common to all of us at
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we were silent again. I knew quite
well what she was waiting for from me, yet I
was silent and troubled. Almost I wished that
I had not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have thought over what I told you
when you were here,&#8221; she said, softly. &#8220;You
have thought of it, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;How could I help it&mdash;how
could I think of anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have remembered that you are my
daughter,&#8221; she added, with a little quiver in her
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I kept my eyes upon the carpet; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very hard,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;very hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think so,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I do not
wish to be. It is not I who have made myself;
I cannot control my instincts. I do not wish to
say anything to you unless it comes from my
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_231" id="Page_231" title="231"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You are my daughter,&#8221; she murmured,
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;yet consider that I
have only known it a few days. Do you think
that I can feel&mdash;like that&mdash;towards you so soon?
It is impossible. A few weeks ago we were
strangers. I cannot forget that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She winced a little at the word, but I repeated
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may seem an odd thing to say, but so far
at any rate as I was concerned, we were
strangers. I do feel&mdash;differently towards you
now of course. In time the rest will come, no
doubt, but I should only be a hypocrite if I pretended
more at present, you must see that;
and,&#8221; I continued, with a shade of bitterness in
my tone, &#8220;there is the shame. One cannot forget
that all at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank back as though I had struck her
a blow across the face. Unwittingly I knew
that I had wounded her deeply. But how could
I help it?</p>

<p>&#8220;The shame,&#8221; she repeated in a low tone&mdash;&#8220;ay,
the shame. That seems an odd word for
me to hear. But it is a true one. I must learn
to bear it. There is the shame! Oh, God! this
is my punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot deny it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;How could
you ever have thought of it in any other way?
You deliberately chose to live with my father<a class="page" name="Page_232" id="Page_232" title="232"></a>
without marrying him. By your own admission
there was not the faintest obstacle to your
marriage. You had the satisfaction of living up
to your theories, I have to pay the penalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands and
there was a long silence between us. The clock
in the room seemed suddenly to commence a
louder ticking; outside, the yellow leaves came
fluttering to the ground, and the wet wind went
sighing through the tree tops. The rain dashed
against the steaming window panes. I looked
away from the bowed figure before me out into
the desolate road, and found my thoughts suddenly
slipping away from me. I wondered
where Bruce Deville was, and Olive Berdenstein.
Were they together and was she succeeding
in her purpose? After all what did it
matter to me, a poor, nameless girl, with a
shadowed past and a blank future? I sighed,
and looked back into the room. The sound of
her voice broke the silence, which was becoming
unbearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to excuse myself,&#8221; she said,
softly; &#8220;nothing can excuse me. But in those
days, when I was young and enthusiastic, it
seemed to me that I had but to lead and the
world would follow me. I thought that by the
time my children were grown up&mdash;if I had chil<a class="page" name="Page_233" id="Page_233" title="233"></a>dren&mdash;what
is called illegitimacy would be no
longer a thing to fear. You see I dwelt for a
little time in a fool&#8217;s elysium. Believe me that
I am sharing with you the punishment&mdash;nay,
mine is the greater half, for I believe that my
heart is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was moved to pity then and took her hands.
But as yet the veil hung between us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will believe that,&#8221; I said, softly; &#8220;I shall
try always to remember it. I will not think
hardly of you in any way. The rest must come
gradually I think&mdash;no, I am sure that it will
come some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were soft with gratitude. She held
out her hands to me, and I gave her mine freely.
We spoke no more upon that subject. But
perhaps what I went on to say was almost as
interesting to her. I had been thinking of it
for some time, now it became inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a purpose in coming to see you this
afternoon,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I want to talk to you about
it. Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. I continued almost immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to ask for your advice,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I want presently, when this trouble has passed
over and Olive Berdenstein has gone away, to
leave home, to take up some work of my own.
In short, I want to be independent, to take my
life into my own hands and shape it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_234" id="Page_234" title="234"></a></p>

<p>She looked at me with a certain wistful
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Independent? Yes, you look like that,&#8221; she
said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case I have no taste for a home life,&#8221;
I continued. &#8220;After what has passed I should
find it unbearable. I want active work, and
plenty of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, with a sigh, &#8220;I can well understand.
Yes, I know what you feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not altogether, I thought to myself, with a
little wan smile. She did not know everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to get right away from here,&#8221;
I continued. &#8220;I should like to go to London.
I don&#8217;t know exactly what work I am fitted
for; I should find that out in time. I took a
good degree at Heidelberg, but I should hate
to be a governess. I thought perhaps you
might be able to suggest something.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden light had flashed into her face in
the middle of my little speech. Evidently some
thought had occurred to her which she hesitated
to confide to me. When I had finished
she looked at me half nervously, half doubtfully.
She seemed to be on the point of suggesting
something, yet she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is anything which has occurred to
you,&#8221; I begged her, &#8220;do not mind letting me
hear it, at any rate. I am not afraid to work,<a class="page" name="Page_235" id="Page_235" title="235"></a>
and I shall not be very particular as to its exact
nature so long as it does not altogether deprive
me of my liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering,&#8221; she said, looking at me
keenly, and with a faint color in her cheeks&mdash;&#8220;I
was wondering whether you would care to accept
a post as my secretary. I am really in urgent
want of one,&#8221; she added, quickly; &#8220;I wrote
out an advertisement to send to the <i>Guardian</i>
last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your secretary?&#8221; I repeated, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you would have to learn typewriting,
and it would be dry work. But, on the other
hand, you would have a good deal of time to
yourself. You would be to a very large extent
your own mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>I scarcely knew how to answer her, yet on
the whole the idea was an attractive one to me.
She saw me hesitate, but she saw also that it
was by no means in displeasure. Before I
could find anything to say she spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, think of it,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t decide all at once. You would live
with me, of course, and I could give you sixty
pounds a year. It does not seem much, but
you would scarcely get more than that to start
with at anything. Listen! Isn&#8217;t that Mr. Deville?&#8221;</p>

<p>I sprang up and moved towards the door.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_236" id="Page_236" title="236"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you told me that you were not
expecting him to-day!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not expecting him&mdash;in fact, he told
me that he was going to Mellborough. But
does it matter? Don&#8217;t you want to see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; I cried, breathlessly; &#8220;he is coming
across the lawn. I am going out the other
way. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what has poor Bruce done to offend
you?&#8221; she cried, in some concern. &#8220;I thought
you were getting such friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not offended me,&#8221; I answered,
quickly. &#8220;Only I don&#8217;t want to see him to-day.
Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran down the path, leaving her standing at
the front door. I just saw the back of Bruce
Deville&#8217;s Norfolk coat as he entered the house
by the French windows, and I hoped that I
had escaped him. But before I was half way
through the little plantation I heard firm footsteps
behind me and then a voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Miss Ffolliot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I answered,
without looking round.</p>

<p>There was only room for one in the path.
He passed me, taking a huge stride through
the undergrowth, and turning round blocked
the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he asked, quietly.<a class="page" name="Page_237" id="Page_237" title="237"></a>
&#8220;What have I done? Why are you trying to
avoid me, like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I
answered, untruthfully, and with burning
cheeks. &#8220;Be so good as to let me pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till you tell me how I have contrived
to offend you,&#8221; he answered, bluntly. &#8220;I called
three times at the Vicarage last week. You
would not see me; you were at home. I found
that out, but you would not see me. The answer
was the same each time, and now this afternoon
you have done your best to avoid me.
I want to know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone and his attitude were alike uncompromising.
I looked round in vain for some
means of escape. It was not possible. After
all this was no breach of my compact with the
girl. I felt simply powerless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not offended me&mdash;not yet, at any
rate,&#8221; I said, with emphasis. &#8220;If you keep me
standing here against my will another minute
you most certainly will though. Please let me
pass, I am in a hurry to get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, I will walk with you,&#8221; he
declared, standing on one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no room,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see about that,&#8221; he answered. He
moved from in front of me, and then, leaving
me the whole path, came crashing through the
underwood and bracken by my side. I walked<a class="page" name="Page_238" id="Page_238" title="238"></a>
along swiftly, and he kept pace with me. After
all he seemed to have nothing to say. We had
almost reached the Rectory gate before he
opened his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will not tell me why you have
avoided me the last few days, Miss Ffolliot.
What have I done to lose your good opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a curious earnestness in his tone.
I felt my cheeks flush. I might perhaps have
answered him in a different manner, but suddenly
my eyes were riveted on a moving figure
coming along the road into which we had
stepped. I looked at it steadily. It was Olive
Berdenstein, plodding along through the thick
mud with careful, mincing footsteps, her long,
loose cape and waving hat, easily distinguishable
even at that distance. I stepped forward
hastily, and before he could stop me, he passed
through the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not wait, please, Mr. Deville,&#8221; I said,
looking round at him. &#8220;There is a friend of
yours coming round the lane. Go and meet
her, and do not say anything about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was very rude and very profane. He
made use of an expression in connection with
Olive Berdenstein which justified me in hurrying
away.</p>

<p>I turned my back upon him and ran up the
drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ffolliot,&#8221; he cried out, &#8220;one moment;<a class="page" name="Page_239" id="Page_239" title="239"></a>
I am very sorry. I apologize most abjectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned round and waved my hand. Anything
to get rid of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well! Go and meet Miss Berdenstein,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not at all sure that he did not repeat
the offence. At any rate, he turned away, and
a few moments later, from my bedroom window,
I saw him greet her. They turned away
together towards the path. I watched them
with a little sigh.</p>

<span class="chap">MY DILEMMA</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed to me during the days that followed
that I was confronted with a problem of
more than ordinary complexity. I at any rate
found it so. To live through childhood and
girlhood wholly unconscious of the existence
of a living mother, and then to find her like
this, with such a history, was altogether a bewildering
and unrealizable thing. Was I unnatural
that I had not fallen into her arms?
Ought I to have heard her story with sympathy,
or at least, with simulated sympathy? At any
rate I had not erred on the side of kindness towards
her! I had made her suffer, and suffer
very bitterly. Yet was not that inevitable?
The seed was of her own sowing, not of mine.
I was her unconscious agent. The inevitable
requital of offences against the laws of social
order had risen up against her in my person.
If I had pretended an affection which I certainly
had not felt, I must have figured as a hypocrite&mdash;and
she was not the woman to desire that.
I liked her. I had been attracted towards her<a class="page" name="Page_241" id="Page_241" title="241"></a>
from the first. Doubtless that attraction, which
was in itself intuitive, was due to the promptings
of nature. In that case it would develop.
It seemed to me that this offer of hers&mdash;to go
to her with a definite post and definite duties
would be the best of all opportunities for such
development. I was strongly inclined to accept
it. I was both lonely and unhappy. In a
certain sense my education and long residence
abroad had unfitted me for this sedentary (in
a mental sense) and uneventful life. The events
of the last few weeks had only increased my
restlessness. There was something from which
I desired almost frantically to escape, certain
thoughts which I must do my utmost to drown.
At all costs I desired to leave the place. Its
environment had suddenly become stifling to
me. The more I considered my mother&#8217;s offer
the more I felt inclined to accept it.</p>

<p>And accept it I did. Early one morning I
walked down to the Yellow House, and in a
very few words engaged myself as Mrs. Fortress&#8217;s
secretary. We were both of us careful,
for opposite reasons, not to discuss the matter
in any but a purely businesslike spirit. Yet she
could not altogether conceal the satisfaction
which my decision certainly gave her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope that you will not find the life
too monotonous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a good<a class="page" name="Page_242" id="Page_242" title="242"></a>
deal of hard work to be done, of course, and
mine is not altogether interesting labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard work is just what I want,&#8221; I assured
her. &#8220;It will be strange at first, of course, but
I do not mind the monotony of it. I want to
escape from my thoughts. I feel as though I
had been living through a nightmare here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with a soft light in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;poor child!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was afraid that she was going to ask me
questions which I could not well have answered,
so I rose to my feet and turned away. Yet
there was something soothing in her evident
sympathy. She walked to the door with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall you be ready to go to London
with me?&#8221; she asked, upon the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any time,&#8221; I answered, promptly. &#8220;There
is nothing I desire so much as to leave here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write to have my little place put in
order to-day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It will be ready for
us in a week, I dare say. I think that I too
shall be glad to leave here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked quietly home through the shadowy
plantation and across the little stretch of common.
On my way upstairs to my room Mary,
our little housemaid, interrupted me.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a young lady in the drawing room
waiting to see you, miss,&#8221; she announced; &#8220;she
came directly after you went.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_243" id="Page_243" title="243"></a></p>

<p>I retraced my steps slowly. Of course I knew
who it was. I opened the door, and found her
sitting close to the fire.</p>

<p>She rose at once to her feet, and looked at
me a little defiantly. I greeted her as pleasantly
as I could, but she was evidently in a bad humor.
There was an awkward silence for a moment
or two. I waited for her to explain her
mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you with Mr. Deville the other day,&#8221;
she remarked at last.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite true. I did all that I could to
avoid him. That was what I promised, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the first time you have seen him
since we made our arrangement?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been with him this afternoon?&#8221;
she asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; I assured her. &#8220;I have only
been down to see Mrs. Fortress for a few
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed and looked away from me into
the fire, and when she spoke her voice was thick
with rising sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not care for me. I cannot make
him! My money does not seem to make any<a class="page" name="Page_244" id="Page_244" title="244"></a>
difference. He is too fierce and independent.
I don&#8217;t think that I shall ever be able to make
him care.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked steadily down upon the carpet, and
set my teeth firmly. It was ridiculous that my
heart should be beating so fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you,&#8221; I said, softly.</p>

<p>She fixed her black eyes upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sorry for me,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Very
good, you do not care for him yourself. But
listen! I am afraid, I fear that he cares for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know that,&#8221; I faltered.
&#8220;You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; she interrupted, scornfully. &#8220;I know.
But you&mdash;there is some one else. That is our
secret. Never mind, you do not care for him
at any rate. You shall help me then. What do
you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;Have
I not already done all that I can by refusing to
see him? What more can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all a mistake&mdash;a stupid mistake, that
idea of mine,&#8221; she cried, passionately. &#8220;Men
are such fools. I ought not to have tried to
keep you apart. He has been grim and furious
always because he could not see you. I have
had to suffer for it. It has been hateful. Oh,
if you want to escape the greatest, the most
hideous torture in this world,&#8221; she cried, pas<a class="page" name="Page_245" id="Page_245" title="245"></a>sionately,
her thin voice quavering with nervous
agitation, &#8220;pray to God that you may never
love a man who cares nothing for you. It is unbearable!
It is worse than hell! One is always
humiliated, always in the dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was very sorry for her, and she could not
fail to see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are so sure that he does not care for
you&mdash;that he is not likely to care for you&mdash;would
it not be better to go away and try to
forget him?&#8221; I said. &#8220;It can only make you
more miserable to stay here, if he is not kind
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw a curious glance at me. It was
full of suspicion and full of malice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! of course you would advise me to
go away,&#8221; she exclaimed, spitefully. &#8220;You
would give a good deal to be rid of me. I
know. I wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned over a little nearer to me, and
drew in her breath with a little hiss. Her eyes
were fixed upon my face eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish what?&#8221; I asked her, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that I understood you; I wish I knew
what you were afraid of. What have you to
do with Philip Maltabar? If he is not your
lover, who is he? If he is not your lover, what
of Bruce Deville? Oh! if you have been fooling
me!&#8221; she muttered, with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a little enigmatic,&#8221; I said, coldly.<a class="page" name="Page_246" id="Page_246" title="246"></a>
&#8220;You seem to think that you have a right to
know every detail of my private life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know more, at any rate, than you
will tell me,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;yet there is just
this for you to remember. I am one of those
whose love is stronger than their hate. For
my love&#8217;s sake I have forgotten to hate. But
it may be that my love is vain. Then I shall
put it from me if I can&mdash;crush it even though
my life dies with it. But I shall not forget to
hate. I came here with a purpose. It has
grown weak, but it may grow strong again. Do
you understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean in plain words that if you do not
succeed with Mr. Deville, you will recommence
your search for the man you call Philip Maltabar.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded her head slowly; her keen eyes
were seeking to read mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do as you choose, of course,&#8221; I
answered; &#8220;as regards Mr. Deville, I can do
no more for you than I have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>She commenced twisting her fingers nervously
together, and her eyes never left my
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that you could do more than you
have done,&#8221; she said, meaningly. &#8220;You could
do more if you would. That is why I am here.
I have something to say to you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Better be plain with<a class="page" name="Page_247" id="Page_247" title="247"></a>
me. We have been talking riddles long
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will be plain enough,&#8221; she declared,
with a touch of blunt fierceness in her tone.
&#8220;I believe that he cares for you, I believe that
is why he will not think for a moment even of
me. When I tell you that you know of course
that I hate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have known that for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate you!&#8221; she repeated, sullenly. &#8220;If you
were to die I should be glad. If I had the
means and the strength, I believe, I am sure
that I would kill you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose to my feet with a little shudder. She
was terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think, unless you have anything
more to say, that it is a particularly pleasant interview
for either of us,&#8221; I remarked, with my
hand upon the bell. But she stopped me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something else to propose,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;You have said that you do not love
him. Very well. Perhaps his not seeing you
has irritated him and made him impatient. See
him. Let him ask you&mdash;he will not need much
encouragement&mdash;and refuse him. Answer him
so that he cannot possibly make any mistake.
Be rude to him if you can. Perhaps then, if he
knows that you are not to be moved, he will
come to me. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I understand,&#8221; I said, slowly; &#8220;I<a class="page" name="Page_248" id="Page_248" title="248"></a>
understand perfectly. There is only one thing
you seem to forget. Your idea that Mr. Deville
is interested in me is only a surmise. It is
more than possible that you are altogether mistaken.
He and I are almost strangers. We
have not met a dozen times in our lives. He
has never shown any inclination to make any
sort of proposal to me; I should think it most
unlikely that he should ever do so. Supposing
that you were right, it would probably be
months before he would mention it to me, and
I am going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at me curiously. How I hated
that smile, with its almost feline-like exhibition
of glistening white teeth!</p>

<p>&#8220;He will propose to you if you will let him,&#8221;
she said, confidently. &#8220;If you are really ignorant
of that fact, and of your conquest, I can assure
you of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she broke off and looked intently
out of the window. Across the park in the distance
a tall, familiar figure was coming rapidly
towards us. She turned and faced me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming here now,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I
am going away. You stay here and see him.
Perhaps he will ask you now. Can&#8217;t you help
him on to it? Remember, the more decidedly
you refuse him the safer is Philip Maltabar. Be
rude. Laugh at him; tell him he is too rough,
too coarse for you. That is what he thinks him<a class="page" name="Page_249" id="Page_249" title="249"></a>self.
Hurt his feelings&mdash;wound him. It will be
the better for you. You are a woman, and you
can do it. Listen! Do you want money? I am
rich. You shall have&mdash;I will give you five&mdash;ten
thousand pounds if&mdash;if&mdash;he ever asks me. Ten
thousand pounds, and safety for Philip Maltabar.
You understand!&#8221;</p>

<p>She glided out of the room with white, passionate
face and gleaming eyes. Whither she
went I did not know. I stood there waiting
for my visitor.</p>

<hr class="section-break" />
<div class="section"></div>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="chap">A PROPOSAL</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> left me alone in the room, and I stood
there for a minute or two without moving. I
heard his quick step on the gravel path outside
and then his summons at the door. Mechanically
I rang the bell and directed that he should
be shown in to me.</p>

<p>The door was opened and closed. Then he
was ushered in, our little maid servant announcing
him with a certain amount of unnecessary
emphasis. She withdrew at once, and we were
alone together. As he touched my hand I noticed
that he was wearing a new suit of riding
clothes, which became him very well, and a big
bunch of violets in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have found you at last, have I?&#8221; he
said, standing over me as though he feared I
might even now try to escape. &#8220;Was it by your
maid&#8217;s mistake that I was allowed to come in
this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;I told her only a minute
ago to show you in. I wanted to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are extremely kind,&#8221; he remarked, with<a class="page" name="Page_251" id="Page_251" title="251"></a>
a note of irony in his tone. &#8220;My patience was
very nearly exhausted. I was beginning to
wonder whether I should ever see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was becoming just a question whether
you would,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;We are closing the
house up next week, I believe, and removing
our &#8216;Penates&#8217; to Eastminster. Alice is busy
packing already, and so ought I to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is a hint to me,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I
decline to take any notice of it. I have something
to say to you. I have had to wait long
enough for the opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little more than a week,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind how long,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It
has seemed like a year. Tell me&mdash;are you glad
that you are going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;I am glad
that we are all going away. In any case I
should not have stayed. Perhaps you have
heard that I am going to London with Mrs.
Fortress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently he had not heard. He looked at
me in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Mrs. Fortress?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Did
you say you were going with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I am going to be her secretary. I
thought that she might have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking rather grave; certainly not
pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see what you want to be any one&#8217;s<a class="page" name="Page_252" id="Page_252" title="252"></a>
secretary for,&#8221; he said, frowning. &#8220;You are
going to leave here. Eastminster is a very
pleasant place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I should find it very dull,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;I only admire cathedral cities from
an external point of view. It would bore me
horribly to have to live in one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood there looking down at me in absolute
silence. I raised my eyes and met his
steadfast gaze. I knew then that what this girl
had said was true. Then all of a sudden an unaccountable
thing happened. The composure
on which I prided myself deserted me. My eyes
fell. I could not look at him, my cheeks were
flushed; my heart commenced to beat fast; I
was taken completely at a disadvantage. He
seized the opportunity and commenced to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;you have wondered
what has made me so anxious to see you
these last few days. I am glad to have an opportunity
of telling you. I have been wanting
to for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would have given a good deal to have been
able to stop him, but I could not. I was powerless.
I was as much embarrassed as the
veriest schoolgirl. He went on&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you to be my wife. Miss Ffolliot.
As you know,&#8221; he added, with a sudden
faint flash of humor, &#8220;I am not apt with my<a class="page" name="Page_253" id="Page_253" title="253"></a>
tongue. I am afraid that I have allowed myself
to rust in many ways. But if you will make
the best of me you will make me very happy;
for I think you know that I love you very
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; I cried softly, &#8220;you must not say
that. I did not wish any one to say that to me.
I am not going to marry any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought not to ask me,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;You know my story.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed outright in kindly contempt.
Then I knew I had made a great mistake. I
should have given him some other reason. This
one he would laugh to scorn. And because I
had given it first he would deem it the chief
one in my thoughts. Before I could stop him
he had taken one of my hands and was smoothing
it in his great brown palm. Somehow I
forgot to draw it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever seriously imagine that any
such circumstance could make one iota of difference
to any man who loved you?&#8221; he asked,
in a mild wonder. &#8220;It is preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not preposterous,&#8221; I declared. &#8220;How
can you say so? I am&mdash;nobody. I have not
even a name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please not talk nonsense?&#8221; he interrupted,
firmly. &#8220;We both know quite well
in our hearts that such a circumstance as you
allude to could not make the slightest differ<a class="page" name="Page_254" id="Page_254" title="254"></a>ence&mdash;if
you cared for me as I care for you.
All I want to know is&mdash;do you care&mdash;a little?
If you will give me&mdash;if you can&mdash;just a little
share of your love, the rest will come. I should
not be afraid to wait. I would take my chance.
I have cared for you from the moment you first
came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up at him with wet eyes, but with a
faint smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You managed to conceal your sentiments
admirably on our first meeting,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>He laughed. He was getting absolutely confident;
and all this time I was drifting with a
full knowledge of the shipwreck ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was brutal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Somehow, do you
know, you irritated me that morning? You
looked so calm and self-possessed, and your
very daintiness made me feel rough and coarse.
It was like an awakening for me. Yet I loved
you all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; I said, slowly.</p>

<p>He flashed a keen glance upon me. His
eyes tried to force mine to meet them. I kept
them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not be sorry,&#8221; he said, impetuously;
&#8220;you must be glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be glad about,&#8221; I cried,
with a sob in my throat. &#8220;I do&mdash;I do&mdash;not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; he pressed, relentlessly. &#8220;I do
not care for you in that way,&#8221; he repeated<a class="page" name="Page_255" id="Page_255" title="255"></a>
slowly. &#8220;Is that true? An hour ago I should
have doubted you. But now&mdash;look at me and
tell me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>I nerved myself to a desperate effort. I
looked up and met his stern, compelling gaze.
My cheeks were pale. The words came slowly
and with difficulty. But I told my lie well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care for you. I could never think
of marrying you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose at once. The tears came to my eyes
with a rush. He was very pale, and there was
a look in his face which hurt me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you are very explicit,
and I have been a clumsy fool. But you
might have stopped me before. Goodbye!&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up, and the words were on my lips
to call him back. For the moment I had forgotten
Olive Berdenstein and my bargain with
her. If he had been looking then it would have
been all over. But already his back was vanishing
through the door. I moved slowly to the
window and watched him walk down the drive
with head bent and footsteps less firm than
usual. He crossed the road and took the footpath
across the park which led up to the Court.
In the distance, a weird little figure in her waving
cloak gleaming through the faint mist, I
could see Olive Berdenstein crossing the common
diagonally with the evident intention of
intercepting him. I turned away from the window
and laughed bitterly.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="chap">THE EVIDENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> very weary days dragged themselves by.
We had no news whatever from my father. We
did not even know where he was. Alice and
I were hard at work packing, and already the
house began to look bare and comfortless. All
the rooms, except two were dismantled. We
began to count the days before we might be
able to move into Eastminster. No one came
to call upon us. I saw nothing whatever either
of Olive Berdenstein or of Bruce Deville.</p>

<p>But on the afternoon of the third day I saw
them both from the window of my room. They
came from the plantation leading down to the
Yellow House and turned slowly upwards from
the Court. The girl was much more fittingly
dressed than usual. She was wearing a dark
green tailor-made gown, and even from the
distance at which I stood I could see that she
was walking briskly, and that there was a new
vivacity in her manner and carriage. Her
usually sallow cheeks were touched with a faint
and very becoming tinge of pink. Bruce De<a class="page" name="Page_257" id="Page_257" title="257"></a>ville
too was leaning down towards her with
a little more than his usual consideration. I
watched them from the window, and there was
a pain at my heart like the pain of death. Had
she won already, I wondered? Was a man so
easily to be deceived?</p>

<p>They had come from the Yellow House; he
had been taking her to see Mrs. Fortress. An
irresistible desire seized me. I hurried on my
jacket and hat and walked down there.</p>

<p>The little maid-servant admitted me without
hesitation. Mrs. Fortress was at home, she told
me, and would no doubt see me, although she
was very busy. Hearing my voice, she came
out into the hall to meet me, and led me into
her study.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hard at work, you see,&#8221; she remarked,
pointing to a pile of papers littered all over her
desk. &#8220;When do you think that you will be
able to come into residence with me? I have
had my little flat put in order, and I want to get
there soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can come in about three weeks, I suppose,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;I shall be very glad to. We
hope to move to Eastminster on Monday or
Tuesday. I want to see my father again and to
help them to settle down there. Afterwards
I shall be quite free.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, and looked at me keenly for a
moment or two.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_258" id="Page_258" title="258"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;You are looking tired and worried,&#8221; she
said, sympathetically. &#8220;Has anything fresh
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited for a moment, but she did not
pursue the subject. Still, I fancied that she was
disappointed that I did not offer her my confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bruce Deville has just been here, and
Miss Berdenstein,&#8221; she remarked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw them come through the plantation,&#8221;
I remarked. &#8220;I have not seen Miss Berdenstein
for several days. Is she quite well?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me, and commenced to sort
some papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she is well enough. Bruce Deville
rather puzzles me. He is in a very odd mood.
I have never seen him more attentive to any
one than he is to that girl, and yet all the time
there was a sort of brutal cynicism about his
behavior, and when I asked him to stay and
talk to me he would not. I wonder have
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up into my face and stopped
short. There was a little pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me about it?&#8221; she said, wistfully.
&#8220;Not unless you like, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing much to tell,&#8221; I answered,
controlling my voice with a desperate effort.<a class="page" name="Page_259" id="Page_259" title="259"></a>
&#8220;Mr. Deville asked me something. I was
obliged to say no. He is consoling himself admirably.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed, and looked at me thoughtfully.
That note of bitterness in my tone had betrayed
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bruce Deville is not
exactly a woman&#8217;s man, and he has many faults,
but he is a fine fellow. He is a world too good
anyhow to throw himself away upon that miserable
chit of a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was exactly my own idea. I did not tell
her so, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very rich,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;She can
free his estates and put him in his right position
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is only a trifle,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Besides,
he is not so poor as some people think.
He could live differently now, only he is afraid
that he would have to entertain and be entertained.
He makes his poverty an excuse for a
great many things, but as a matter of fact he
is not nearly so embarrassed as people believe.
The truth is he detests society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not blame him,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Society
is detestable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, I cannot bring myself to believe
that he is thinking seriously about that
girl,&#8221; she continued, anxiously. &#8220;I should hate
to think so!&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_260" id="Page_260" title="260"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Men are enigmas,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;It is precisely
the unexpected which one has always to
expect from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what they say about us,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that most of the things
that men say of women are more true about
themselves? It seems so to me, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose up suddenly, and came and stood
over me. She held out her hands, and I gave
her mine. My eyes were dim. It was strange
to me to find any one who understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to go away with me to-morrow&mdash;right
away from here?&#8221; she asked, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; I asked, with sudden joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To London. Everything is ready for us
there; we only need to send a telegram. I
think&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it would be good for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; I answered, quickly. &#8220;I
have a sort of fancy that if I stay here I shall go
mad. The place is hateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; she said, soothingly. &#8220;You
must make up your mind and come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not hesitate,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;if only
I could feel certain that&mdash;he would not come
back here before Olive Berdenstein leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can make sure of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Write
and tell him that it would not be safe; he ought
not to come.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_261" id="Page_261" title="261"></a></p>

<p>Our eyes met, and I felt impelled to ask her
a sudden question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that he killed her brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me with blanched cheeks and
glanced half-fearfully around. From where I
sat I could see the black bending branches from
that little fir plantation where he had been
found.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else is there to believe?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I heard him myself one awful day&mdash;it was long
ago, but it seems only like yesterday&mdash;I heard
him threaten to kill him if ever he found him
near again. It was outside the gate there that
they met, and then&mdash;in the church you remember&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I held out my hand and stopped her. The
moaning of the wind outside seemed like the
last cry of that dying man. It was too horrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot stay here,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I will go with
you whenever you are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light flashed across her face. She drew
me to her and kissed my forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it would be best,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
too loathe this place! I shall never live here
any more. To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; I interrupted, &#8220;we will go
away.&#8221;</p>

<span class="chap">A GHOST IN WHITECHAPEL</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Despite</span> a certain amount of relief at leaving
a neighborhood so full of horrible associations,
those first few weeks in London were certainly
not halcyon ones. My post was by no
means a sinecure. Every morning I had thirty
or forty letters to answer, besides which there
was an immense amount of copying to be done.
The subject matter of all this correspondence
was by no means interesting to me, and the
work itself, although I forced myself to accomplish
it with at any rate apparent cheerfulness
was tedious and irksome. Apart from all this, I
found it unaccountably hard to concentrate my
thoughts upon my secretarial labors. The sight
of the closely written pages, given me to copy,
continually faded away, and I saw in their stead
Warren slopes with the faint outlines of the
Court&mdash;in the distance Bruce Deville walking
side by side with Olive Berdenstein, as I had
seen them on the day before I had come away.
She had now at any rate what she had so much
desired&mdash;the man whom she loved with so absorbing
a passion&mdash;all to herself, free to devote<a class="page" name="Page_263" id="Page_263" title="263"></a>
himself to her, if he had indeed the inclination,
and with no other companionship at hand to
distract his thoughts from her. I found myself
wondering more than once whether she
would ever succeed in making her bargain with
him. The little news which we had was altogether
indefinite. Alice did not mention either
of them in her scanty letters. She was on the
point of moving to Eastminster&mdash;in fact, she
was already spending most of her time there.
From Bruce Deville himself we had heard nothing,
although my mother had written to him
on the first day of our arrival in London. Once
or twice she had remarked upon his silence, and
I had listened to her surmises without remark.</p>

<p>I am afraid that as a secretary I was not a
brilliant success in those first few unhappy
weeks. But my mother made no complaint. I
could see that it made her happy to have me
with her. My silence she doubtless attributed
to my anxiety concerning my father. I did my
best to hide my unhappiness from her.</p>

<p>News of some sort came from Alice at last.
She wrote from Eastminster saying that she
had nearly finished the necessary preparations
there, and was looking forward to my father&#8217;s
return. She had heard from him that morning,
she said. He was at Ventnor, and much improved
in health. She was expecting him home
in a week.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_264" id="Page_264" title="264"></a></p>

<p>But in the afternoon of that same day a
strange thing happened. My mother was compelled
to go to the East End of London, and
at the last moment insisted upon my going with
her. She was on the committee in connection
with the proposed erection of some improved
dwelling houses somewhere in Whitechapel,
and the meeting was to be held in a school room
in the Commercial Road. I was looking pale,
she said, and the drive there would do me good,
so I went with her, lacking energy to refuse,
and sat in the carriage whilst she went in to the
meeting&mdash;a proceeding which I very soon began
to regret.</p>

<p>The surroundings and environment of the
place were in every way depressing. The carriage
had been drawn up at the corner of two
great thoroughfares&mdash;avenues through which
flows the dark tide of all that is worst and most
wretched of London poverty. For a few minutes
I watched the people. It was horrible, yet
in a sense fascinating. But when the first novelty
had worn off the whole thing suddenly
sickened me. I removed my eyes from the
pavement with a shudder. I would watch the
people no longer. Nothing, I told myself,
should induce me to look again upon that
stream of brutal and unsexed men and women.
I kept my eyes steadfastly fixed upon the rug
at my feet. And then a strange thing happened<a class="page" name="Page_265" id="Page_265" title="265"></a>
to me. Against my will a moment came when I
was forced to raise my eyes. A man hurrying
past the carriage had half halted upon the pavement
only a foot or two away from me. As I
looked up our eyes met. He was dressed in a
suit of rusty black, and he had a handkerchief
tied closely around his neck in lieu of collar.
He was wearing a flannel shirt and no tie. His
whole appearance, so far as dress was concerned,
was miserably in accord with the shabbiness
of his surroundings. Yet from underneath
his battered hat a pair of piercing eyes
met mine, and a delicate mouth quivered for
a moment with a curious and familiar emotion.
I sprang from my seat and struggled frantically
with the fastening of the carriage door. Disguise
was all in vain, so far as I was concerned.
It was my father who stood there looking at
me. I pushed the carriage door open at last
and sprang out upon the pavement. I was a
minute too late&mdash;already he was a vanishing
figure. At the corner of a squalid little court
he turned round and held out one hand threateningly
towards me. I paused involuntarily.
The gesture was one which it was hard to disobey.
Yet I think that I most surely should
have disobeyed it, but for the fact that during
my momentary hesitation he had disappeared.
I hurried forward a few steps. There was no
sign of him anywhere. He had passed down<a class="page" name="Page_266" id="Page_266" title="266"></a>
some steps and vanished in a wilderness of
small courts; to pursue him was hopeless. Already
a little crowd of people were gazing at
me boldly and curiously. I turned round and
stepped back into the carriage.</p>

<p>I waited in an agony of impatience until my
mother came out. Then I told her with trembling
voice what had happened.</p>

<p>Her face grew paler as she listened, but I
could see that she was inclined to doubt my
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could not have been your father,&#8221; she
exclaimed, her voice shaking with agitation.
&#8220;You must have been mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head sadly. There was no possibility
of any mistake so far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my father. That girl has broken her
word,&#8221; I cried bitterly. &#8220;She has seen him
and&mdash;she knows. He is hiding from her!&#8221;</p>

<p>We drove straight to the telegraph office.
My mother wrote out a message to Mr. Deville.
I, too, sent one to Olive. Then we drove back
to our rooms. There was nothing to be done
but wait.</p>

<p>It was six o&#8217;clock before the first answer
came back. It was from Mr. Bruce Deville. I
tore it open and read it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be mistaken. Can answer for it
she has taken no steps. She is still here. Mr.<a class="page" name="Page_267" id="Page_267" title="267"></a>
Ffolliot has not returned. Impossible for them
to have met.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pink paper fluttered to the ground at
our feet. I tore open the second one; it was
from Olive Berdenstein&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not understand you. I have no intention
of breaking our compact.&#8221;</p>

<p>We read them both over again carefully.
Then we looked at one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have taken fright needlessly,&#8221; I
said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still certain, then, that it was he?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221; I answered. &#8220;If only we could
find him! In a week it will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ceremony at Eastminster is on Sunday
week. He was to have been there at least a
week before. I am afraid that he will not go
at all now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must act at once,&#8221; my mother declared,
firmly. &#8220;I know exactly where you saw him.
I will go there at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go there together,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I
shall be ready in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go alone,&#8221; she said, quietly. &#8220;You
would only be in the way. I know the neighborhood
and the people. They will tell me
more if I am alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_268" id="Page_268" title="268"></a></p>

<p>She was away until midnight. When at last
she returned I saw at once by her face that she
had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no clue, then?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat and looked at one another in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But to-morrow came and went, and we were
still hopelessly in the dark. On the morning of
the third day we were in despair. Then, as we
sat over our breakfast, almost in despair, a letter
was brought to me. It was from Alice, and
enclosed in it was one from my father.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;to have been very
anxious about father lately, so I thought you
would like to read this letter from him. We
are almost straight here now, but it has been
very hard work, and I have missed you very
much....&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more of the same sort, but I did
not stop to read it. I passed it on to my
mother, and eagerly read the few lines from my
father. His letter was dated three days ago&mdash;the
very day of my meeting with him in the
Commercial Road, and the postmark was Ventnor.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; he commenced, &#8220;I am better
and shall return for certain on Monday.
The air here is delightful, and I have felt my<a class="page" name="Page_269" id="Page_269" title="269"></a>self
growing stronger every day. If you see
the Bishop tell him that you have heard from
me. My love to Kate, if you are writing. I
hope that she will be coming down for next
week. There is a good deal for me to say to
her.&mdash;Your affectionate father, <span class="smcap">Horace Ffolliot</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother read both letters, and then looked
up at me with a great relief in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all you see you must have been mistaken,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;There can be no
doubt about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I said no more, but one thing was as
certain as my life itself&mdash;the man who had
waved me back from following him along the
pavements of the Commercial Road was most
surely no other man than my father.</p>

<h2 class="chap"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="chap">EASTMINSTER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days that followed were, in a sense, like
the calm before the threatened storm. As the
date of my father&#8217;s promised return to Eastminster
drew near, every day I expected to hear
from Alice that he had abandoned his purpose,
and that Northshire would see him no more.
But no such letter came. On the contrary,
when news did come it was news which astonished
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be glad to hear,&#8221; Alice wrote,
&#8220;that father came back last night looking better,
although rather thin. He did not seem to
have understood that you were already with
Mrs. Fortress, and I think he was disappointed
not to see you. At the same time, considering
that you have acted without consulting him in
any way, and that there is certainly some room
for doubt as to the wisdom of the step you
have taken, I think that he takes your absence
very well. He wants you to come down in a
week for a day or two. No doubt you will be
able to manage this. You must stay for a Sun<a class="page" name="Page_271" id="Page_271" title="271"></a>day.
Father preached last evening, and there
was quite a sensation. Lady Bolton has been
so kind. She says that the Bishop is continually
congratulating himself upon having found
father in the diocese. I have not seen either
Mr. Deville or Miss Berdenstein since I left the
Vicarage. As you can imagine I have been terribly
busy. The house here is simply delightful.
The old oak is priceless, and there are
such quaint little nooks and corners everywhere.
Do come at once. Ever your loving
sister, <span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I passed the letter across to my mother, and
when she had finished it she looked with a smile
into my still troubled face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That proves finally that you were wrong,&#8221;
she remarked, quietly. &#8220;I suppose you have no
more doubts about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. I did not commit myself
to speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I must have been mistaken,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;It was a wonderful likeness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants to see you,&#8221; she continued, looking
wistfully across at me. &#8220;You know what
that means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I think I know what
that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will try to make you leave me,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;Perhaps he will be right. At any rate, he<a class="page" name="Page_272" id="Page_272" title="272"></a>
will think that he is right. It will be a struggle
for you, child. He has a strong will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but I have made
up my mind. Nothing will induce me to change
it&mdash;nothing, at any rate, that my father will be
able to say. Another month like the last would
kill me. Besides, I do not think that I was
meant for a clergyman&#8217;s daughter&mdash;I am too
restless. I want a different sort of life. No,
you need not fear. I shall come back to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought that you would not,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I should be very unhappy. I have made so
many plans for the future&mdash;our future.&#8221;</p>

<p>I crossed the room to the side of her chair
and threw myself down upon my knees, with
my head in her lap. She passed her arms
around me, and I had no need to say a single
word. She understood.</p>

<p>I think as I walked down the little main
street of Eastminster that sunny morning I
knew that the crisis in these strange events was
fast drawing near. The calm of the last few
days had been too complete. Almost I could
have persuaded myself that the events of the
last month or two had been a dream. No one
could possibly have imagined that the thunderclouds
of tragedy were hovering over that old-fashioned,
almost cloistral, dwelling house
lying in the very shadows of the cathedral. My
father was, beyond a doubt, perfectly at his<a class="page" name="Page_273" id="Page_273" title="273"></a>
ease, calm and dignified, and wearing his new
honors with a wonderful grace and dignity.
Alice was perfectly happy in the new atmosphere
of a cathedral town. To all appearance
they were a model father and daughter, settling
down for a very happy and uneventful life. But
to me there was something unnatural alike in
my father&#8217;s apparent freedom from all anxiety
and in Alice&#8217;s complacent ignorance. I could
not breathe freely in the room whilst they
talked with interest about their new surroundings
and the increased possibilities of their new
life. But what troubled me most perhaps was
that my father absolutely declined to discuss
with me anything connected with the past. On
every occasion when I sought to lead up to it
he had at once checked me peremptorily. Nor
would he suffer me to allude in any way to my
new life. Once, when I opened my lips to frame
some suggestive sentence, I caught a light in
his eyes before which I was dumb. Gradually
I began to realize what it meant. By leaving
him for my mother, I had virtually declared
myself on her side. All that I had been before
went for nothing. In his eyes I was no longer
his daughter. Whatever fears he had he kept
them from me. I should no longer have even
those tragic glimpses into his inner life. My
anxieties, indeed, were to be lessened as my
knowledge was to be less. Yet that was a<a class="page" name="Page_274" id="Page_274" title="274"></a>
thought which brought me little consolation.
I felt as though I had deserted a brave man.</p>

<p>I had come for a walk to escape from it, and
at the end of the little line of shops issuing from
the broad archway of the old-fashioned hotel I
came face to face with Bruce Deville. He was
carefully, even immaculately, dressed in riding
clothes, and he was carrying himself with a
new ease and dignity. Directly he saw me he
stopped short and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fortune!&#8221; he exclaimed, forgetting for
the moment, or appearing to forget, to release
my hand. &#8220;I heard that you were down, and I
was going to call. It is much pleasanter to
meet you though!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was miserably and unaccountably nervous.
Our old relative positions seemed suddenly to
have become reversed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go back, then,&#8221; I said; &#8220;it is only
a moment&#8217;s walk to the close.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon the sleeve of my jacket
and checked me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! it is you whom I wanted to see. I
may not be able to talk to you alone at your
house, and, besides, your father might not allow
me to enter it. Will you come for a short
walk with me? There is a way through the
fields a little higher up. I have something to
say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I suffered myself to be easily persuaded.<a class="page" name="Page_275" id="Page_275" title="275"></a>
There was something positively masterful about
the firm ring of his voice, the strong touch of
his fingers, the level, yet anxious glance of his
keen, grey eyes. Anyhow I went with him.
He appeared to know the way perfectly. Soon
we were walking slowly along a country road,
and Eastminster lay in the valley behind us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Miss Berdenstein?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a gleam of something
in his eyes which puzzled me. It was half
kindly, half humorous. Then in an instant I
understood. The girl had told him. Something
decided had happened then between
them. Perhaps she had told him everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that Miss Berdenstein
has gone to London. Don&#8217;t you feel that
you owe me a very humble plea for forgiveness?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>His lips relaxed a little. He was half smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not make a deliberate plot against
me in conjunction with Miss Berdenstein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that I understand you,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I certainly did not originate any plot
against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but you fell in with it. I know all
about it, so you may just as well confess. Miss
Berdenstein was to leave off making inconveni<a class="page" name="Page_276" id="Page_276" title="276"></a>ent
inquiries about Philip Maltabar, and you
were to be as rude to me as you could. Wasn&#8217;t
that something like the arrangement? You see
I know all about it. I have had the benefit of
a full confession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you know,&#8221; I remarked, &#8220;you do not need
to ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite true,&#8221; he answered, opening a
gate and motioning me to precede him. &#8220;But
at the same time I thought that it would be
rather&mdash;well, piquant to hear the details from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very ungenerous,&#8221; I said, coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Do you know I
only discovered this diabolical affair yesterday,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Deville!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned round and looked at me. I was
standing in the middle of the path, and I daresay
I looked as angry as I felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you the truth,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Afterwards,
if you allude to the matter at all I shall
go away at once. The girl has it in her power,
as you know, to do us terrible harm. She, of
her own accord, offered to forego that power
forever&mdash;although she is quite ignorant of its
extent&mdash;if I would not see or talk with you.
She was a little fool to make the offer, of course,
but I should have been more foolish still if I
had not accepted it. She imagined that our<a class="page" name="Page_277" id="Page_277" title="277"></a>
relative positions were different. However,
that is of no consequence, of course. I made
the bargain, and I kept my part of it. I avoided
you, and I left the neighborhood. You have
reminded me that I am not keeping to the letter
of my agreement in being here with you. I
should prefer your leaving me, as I can find my
way home quite well alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unnecessary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The agreement
is off. Miss Berdenstein and I have had
an understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are engaged, then?&#8221; I faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; he said, coolly, &#8220;I should perhaps
have said a misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the truth at once,&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am most anxious to do so,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;She was, as you remarked, a little fool. She
became sentimental, and I laughed at her. She
became worse, and I put her right. That was
last night. She was silly enough to get into a
passion, and from her incoherencies I gathered
the reason why you were so unapproachable
those last few days at the Vicarage. That is
why I got up at six o&#8217;clock this morning and
rode into Eastminster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come here this morning?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s only thirty miles,&#8221; he answered,
coolly. &#8220;I wanted to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was silent for a few moments. This was<a class="page" name="Page_278" id="Page_278" title="278"></a>
news indeed. What might come of it I
scarcely dared to think. A whole torrent of
surmises came flooding in upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In London, I should think, by this time,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p>I drew a long breath of relief. To be rid of
her for a time would be happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that she intends
to return to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>After all it was perhaps the best thing that
could happen; if she had been in earnest&mdash;and I
knew that she had been in earnest&mdash;she would
hate England now. At any rate she would not
want to come back again just yet. My face
cleared. After all it was good news.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone&mdash;out of our lives, I hope,&#8221; he
said, quietly, &#8220;and in her hysterics she left one
little legacy behind for me&mdash;and that is hope.
I know that I am not half good enough for
you,&#8221; he said, with an odd little tremble in his
tone, &#8220;but you have only seen the worst of me.
Do you think that you could care for me a little?
Would you try?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then when I should have been strong I was
pitiably weak. I struggled for words in despair.
He was so calm, so strong, so confident.
How was I to stand against him?</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; I said; &#8220;you know who I
am. I shall never marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed at me scornfully.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_279" id="Page_279" title="279"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;If that is all,&#8221; he said, taking my hands
suddenly into his, &#8220;you shall not leave me until
you have promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he was very bold, and I should have
been very angry, but was not. He looked
coolly round, and finding that there was no one
in sight, he drew me to him and kissed me.
His arms were like steel bars around me, I
could not possibly escape. After that there
were no words which I could say. I was
amazed at myself, but I was very happy. The
twilight was falling upon the city when we
walked once more through the little streets,
and my veil was closely drawn to hide my wet
eyes.</p>

<p>My lover&mdash;I dared to call him that at last&mdash;was
coming home with me, and for a few brief
moments my footsteps seemed to be falling
upon air.</p>

<p>I allowed myself the luxury of forgetfulness;
the load of anxiety which had seemed crushing
had suddenly rolled away. But at the entrance
to the close a little dark figure met us face to
face, and my blood ran cold in my veins, for
she lifted her veil, and my dream of happiness
vanished into thin air. Her face was like the
face of an evil spirit, yet she would have passed
me without a word, but that I held out my
hand and stopped her.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_280" id="Page_280" title="280"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;What
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at me with the malice of a fiend.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a little call,&#8221; she said, &#8220;which I was
paying upon your father. He was unfortunately
not at home. No matter, I shall call again; I
shall call again and again until I see him. I am
in no hurry to leave. Eastminster is such an
interesting place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then my heart died away within me, and the
light of my sudden happiness grew dim. She
looked from one to the other of us, and her
eyes were lit with a new fury. Some subtle instinct
seemed to guide her to the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I congratulate you both?&#8221; she asked,
with a sneer in her tone. &#8220;A little sudden, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not answer. I had no words, and
Bruce remained grimly and contemptuously silent.
She gathered up her skirts, and her eyes
flashed an evil light upon us.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;it is an admirable
arrangement! How happy you both look!
Don&#8217;t let me keep you! I shall call later on
this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flitted away like a dark shadow and
passed underneath the stone archway out of the
close. I covered my face with my hands and
moaned. It had come at last, then. All that I
had done had been useless. I was face to face
with despair.</p>

<span class="chap">THE BREAKING OF THE STORM</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at evensong in the great cathedral
that she tasted the first fruits of her triumph.
During the earlier portion of the service the
shadows had half enveloped the huge body of
the building, and the white faces of the congregation
had been only dimly visible to us from
where we sat in one of the high side pews. But
when my father ascended the steps into the pulpit,
and stood for a minute looking downwards
with the light from a little semi-circle of candles
thrown upon his pale, delicate face, I
caught the sound of a sharp, smothered cry
from a seat close to ours. With a little shiver
of dread I looked around. She had half risen
from her seat, and was leaning over the front
of the pew. Her eyes were riveted upon him,
and her thin, sallow face was white with sudden
excitement. I saw him look up, and their
eyes met for one terrible moment. He did not
flinch or falter. But for the slightly prolonged
resting of his eyes upon her eager, strained face
he took no more notice of her than of any other<a class="page" name="Page_282" id="Page_282" title="282"></a>
member of the congregation. I alone knew
that her challenge had been met and answered,
and it was my hard fate to sit there and suffer
in silence.</p>

<p>There was no mark of nervousness or weakness
of any sort in the sermon he preached. He
seemed to be speaking with a consciousness
perhaps that it might be for the last time, and
with a deliberate effort that some part of those
delicately chosen sentences might leave an everlasting
mark behind him. Already his fame as
a preacher was spreading, and many of the
townspeople were there, attracted by his presence.
They listened with a rare and fervid attention.
As for me, it seemed that I should
never altogether lose the memory of that low,
musical voice, never once raised above its ordinary
pitch, yet with every word penetrating
softly and clearly into the furthermost corner
of the great building. There was a certain wistfulness
in his manner that night, a gentle, pathetic
eloquence which brought glistening tears
into the eyes of more than one of the little
throng of listeners. For he spoke of death, and
of the leaving behind of all earthly things&mdash;of
death, and of spiritual death&mdash;of the ties between
man and woman and man and God. It
was all so different to what is generally expected
from a preacher with the reputation of
eloquence, so devoid of the usual arts of oratory,<a class="page" name="Page_283" id="Page_283" title="283"></a>
and yet so sweetly human, &aelig;sthetically beautiful
that when at last, with a few words, in a
sense valedictory he left the pulpit, and the low
strains of the organ grew louder and louder. I
slipped from my seat and groped across the
close with my eyes full of blinding tears. I
had a passionate conviction that I had misjudged
my father. Suddenly he seemed to loom
before my eyes in a new light&mdash;the light of a
martyr. My judgments concerning him
seemed harsh and foolish. Who was I to judge
such a man as that? He was as far above me as
the stars, and I had refused him my sympathy.
He had begged for it, and I had refused it! I
had left him to carry his burden alone! It
seemed to me then that never whilst I lived
could I escape from the bitterness of this sudden
whirlwind of regret.</p>

<p>Swiftly though I had walked from the cathedral,
he was already in his study when I entered
the house. I opened the door timidly. He was
sitting in his chair leaning back with half-closed
eyes like a man overcome with sudden pain. I
fell on my knees by his side and took his fingers
in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I have done my best to
keep her away! I have done all that I could!&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand pressed mine gently. Then there
was a loud ringing at the bell. I sprang up
white with fear.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_284" id="Page_284" title="284"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I will not let her come here!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;We
will say that you are ill! She must go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless,&#8221; he said, quietly; &#8220;it must come
sooner or later&mdash;better now perhaps. Let us
wait, I have left word that she is to be shown
in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Then we heard
steps in the hall, the rustling of a woman&#8217;s
gown, and the door was opened and closed.
She came forward to the edge of the little circle
of light thrown around us by my father&#8217;s
reading lamp. There she stood with a great
red spot burning in her cheeks, and a fierce
light in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, then, the mystery is solved,&#8221; she
cried, triumphantly. &#8220;I was a fool or I should
have guessed it long ago! Have you forgotten
me, Philip Maltabar?&#8221;</p>

<p>My father rose to his feet. He was serene,
but grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have not forgotten you, Olive Berdenstein,&#8221;
he said, slowly. &#8220;Yours is not a
name to be forgotten by me. Say what you
have come to say, please, and go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, and laughed
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you need not fear,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I
have not come to stay. I recognized you in the
cathedral, and I should have been on my way<a class="page" name="Page_285" id="Page_285" title="285"></a>
to the police station by now, but first I promised
myself the pleasure of this visit. Your
daughter and I are such friends, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father took up some writing paper and
dipped his pen in the ink as though about to
commence a letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you had better go
now. The police station closes early here, and
you will have to hurry as it is&mdash;that is, if you
wish to get a warrant to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him fixedly. He certainly had
no fear. My heart beat fast with the admiration
one has always for a brave man. The girl
was being cheated of her triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must hurry; I
am going to them and I shall say I know now
who was my brother&#8217;s murderer! It was Philip
Maltabar, the man who calls himself Canon
Ffolliot. But though he may be a very holy
man, I can prove him to be a murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is rather a hard word,&#8221; my father remarked,
with a faint smile at the corners of his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a true one,&#8221; she cried, fiercely. &#8220;You
killed him. You cannot deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not deny it,&#8221; he answered, quietly. &#8220;It
is quite true that I killed your brother&mdash;or
rather that in a struggle between us I struck
him a blow from the effects of which he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time I had felt that it must be so.<a class="page" name="Page_286" id="Page_286" title="286"></a>
Yet to hear him confess it so calmly, and without
even the most ordinary emotion, was a
shock to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same thing,&#8221; she said, scornfully,
&#8220;you killed him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the eyes of the law it is not the same
thing,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but let that pass. I had
warned your brother most solemnly that if he
took a certain course I should meet him as man
to man, and I should show him no mercy. Yet
he persisted in that course. He came to my
home! I had warned him not to come. Even
then I forbore. His errand was fruitless. He
had only become a horror in the eyes of the
woman whom he had deceived. She would not
see him, she wished never to look upon his face
again. He persisted in seeking to force his
way into her presence. On that day I met him.
I argued and reasoned with him, but in vain.
Then the first blow was struck, and only the
merest chance intervened, or the situation
would have been reversed. Your brother was
a coward then, Olive Berdenstein, as he had
been all his life. He struck at me treacherously
with a knife. Look here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw open his waistcoat, and she started
back with horror. There was a terrible wound
underneath the bandage which he removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a blow for a blow,&#8221; he said, gravely.
&#8220;From my wound I shall in all likelihood die.<a class="page" name="Page_287" id="Page_287" title="287"></a>
Your brother&#8217;s knife touched my lung, and I
am always in danger of internal bleeding. The
blow I struck him, I struck with his knife at my
heart. That is not murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; she muttered between her
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as you will,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;There
is one thing more which you may as well know.
My unhappy meeting with your brother on that
Sunday afternoon was not our first meeting
since his return to England. On the very night
of his arrival I met him in London by appointment.
I warned him that if he persisted in a
certain course I should forget my cloth, and remember
only that I was a man and that he was
an enemy. He listened in silence, and when I
turned to leave he made a cowardly attempt
upon my life. He deliberately attempted to
murder me. Nothing but an accident saved my
life. But I am not telling you these things to
gain your pity. Only you have found me out,
and you are his sister. It is right that you
should know the truth. I have told you the
whole story. Will you go now?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, and for a moment she
hesitated. Then her eyes met mine, and her
face hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will go,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I do not
care whether you have told me the truth or not.<a class="page" name="Page_288" id="Page_288" title="288"></a>
I am going to let the world know who Canon
Ffolliot is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do as seems best to you,&#8221; my
father said, quietly.</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet, and stood with his
hand at his side, breathing heavily, in an attitude
now familiar to me, although I had never
fully understood its cause. His pale lips were
twitching with pain, and there were dark rims
under his eyes. She looked at him and laughed
brutally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daughter is an excellent actress,&#8221; she
said, looking back over her shoulder as she
moved towards the door. &#8220;I have no doubt
but that the art is inherited. We shall see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Obeying my father&#8217;s gesture, I rang the bell.
We heard the front door open and close after
her. Then I threw my arms around his neck
in a passionate abandonment of grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all my fault,&#8221; I sobbed&mdash;&#8220;my fault!
But for me she would have forgiven.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father smiled a faint, absent smile. He
was smoothing my hair gently with one hand
and gazing steadfastly into the fire. His face
was serene, almost happy. Yet the blow had
fallen.</p>

<span class="chap">THE MASTER OF COLVILLE HALL</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I believe</span> that I took off my clothes and
made some pretence of going to bed, but in
my memory those long hours between the time
when I left father in the study and the dawn
seems like one interminable nightmare. Yet
towards morning I must have slept, for my
room was full of sunlight when a soft knocking
at the door awakened me. Our trim little
housemaid entered with a note; the address
was in my father&#8217;s handwriting. I sat up in bed
and tore open the envelope eagerly. Something
seemed to tell me even before I glanced at
its contents that the thing I dreaded was coming
to pass. This is what I read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, child, if I have left you with
only a written farewell. The little strength I
have left I have need of, and I shrank from seeing
you again lest the sorrow of it should sap
my purpose; should make me weak when I
need to be strong. The girl will tell her story,
and at the best my career of usefulness here is
over; so I leave Eastminster this morning forever.
I have written to Alice and to the<a class="page" name="Page_290" id="Page_290" title="290"></a>
Bishop. To him I have sent a brief memoir
of my life. I do not think that he will be a
stern judge, especially as the culprit stands already
with one foot in the grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, child, I have a final confession to
make to you. For many years there has been
a side to my life of which you and Alice have
been ignorant. Even now I am not going to
tell you about it. The time is too short for me
to enter thoroughly into my motives and into
the gradual development of what was at first
only a very small thing. But of this I am
anxious to assure you, it is not a disgraceful
side! It is not anything of which I am
ashamed, although there have been potent reasons
for keeping all record of it within my own
breast. Had I known to what it was destined
to grow I should have acted differently from
the commencement, but of that it is purposeless
now to speak. The little remnant of life which
is still mine I have dedicated to it. Even if my
career here were not so clearly over, my conscience
tells me that I am doing right in abandoning
it. It is possible that we may never
meet again. Farewell! If what you hinted at
last night comes really to pass it is good. Bruce
Deville has been no friend of mine, but he is
as worthy of you as any man could be. And
above all, remember this, my fervent prayer:
Forgive me the wrong which I have done you<a class="page" name="Page_291" id="Page_291" title="291"></a>
and the trouble which I have brought into your
life. Think of me if you can only as your most
affectionate father, <span class="smcap">Horace Ffolliot</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I had finished my father&#8217;s letter I
dressed in haste. There was no doubt in my
mind as to where he had gone. I would follow
him at once. I would be by his side wherever
he was and in whatever condition when
the end came. I rang for a time-table and
looked out the morning trains for London.
Then Alice knocked at my door and came to
me with white, scared face, and an open letter
in her hand. She found me all ready to start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand it? What does it mean,
Kate?&#8221; she asked, fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;He has gone
to London, and he is not fit to leave his bed. I
am going to follow him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do not know whereabouts to look.
You will never find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must trust to fate,&#8221; I answered, desperately.
&#8220;Somehow or other I shall find him.
Goodbye. I have only a few minutes to catch
the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came to the door with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; I asked, upon the step.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remain here,&#8221; she answered, firmly.
&#8220;I shall not leave until it is perfectly certain
that this is not all some hideous mistake. I
can&#8217;t realize it, Kate.&#8221;</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_292" id="Page_292" title="292"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I cried, lingering impatiently upon
the step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that he is mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;I am certain that he is
not,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I will write to you; perhaps
to-night. I may have news.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked across the close, where as yet not
a soul was stirring. The ground beneath my
feet was hard with a white frost, and the air was
keen and bright. The sunlight was flashing
upon the cathedral windows, the hoar-covered
ivy front of the deanery gleamed like silver, and
a little group of tame pigeons lit at my feet and
scarcely troubled to get out of the way of my
hasty footsteps. A magnificent serenity
reigned over the little place. It seemed as
though the touch of tragedy could scarcely penetrate
here. Yet as I turned into the main
street of the still sleeping town my heart gave
a great leap and then died away within me. A
few yards ahead was the familiar fur-coated little
figure, also wending her way towards the
station.</p>

<p>She turned round at the ringing sound of
my footsteps, and her lips parted in a dark,
malicious smile. She waited for me, and then
walked on by my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a two hours&#8217; start,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so far
as you are concerned; that means that you will
not find him. But with me it is different. I<a class="page" name="Page_293" id="Page_293" title="293"></a>
found out his flight in time to wire to London.
At St. Pancras a detective will meet the train.
He will be followed wherever he goes, and word
will be sent to me. To-night he will be in
prison. Canon Ffolliot, you know&mdash;your father&mdash;in
prison! I wonder, will the wedding be
postponed? Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>She peered up into my face. I kept my eyes
steadily fixed upon the end of the street where
the station was, and ground my teeth together.
The only notice I took of her was to increase
my pace so that she could scarcely keep up with
me. I could hear her breath coming sharply
as she half walked, half ran along at my side.
Then, at last, as we came in sight of the station,
my heart gave a great leap, and a little exclamation
of joy broke upon my lips. A man was
standing under the portico with his face turned
towards us. It was Bruce Deville.</p>

<p>She too gave vent to a little exclamation
which sounded almost like a moan. For the
first time I glanced into her face. Her lips
were quivering, her dark eyes, suddenly dim,
were soft with despair. She caught at my arm
and commenced talking rapidly in spasmodic
little gasps. Her tone was no longer threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a chance for you,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You
can save your father. You could take him
away&mdash;to Italy, to the south of France. He<a class="page" name="Page_294" id="Page_294" title="294"></a>
would recover. You would never have anything
to fear from me again. I should be your
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You had your
chance. I did what you asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank back as though I had stabbed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not too late,&#8221; she said, feverishly.
&#8220;Make it the test of his love. It will not be forever.
I am not strong. I may not live more
than a year or two. Let me have him&mdash;for that
time. It is to save your father. Pray to him.
He will consent. He does not dislike me. But,
mon Dieu! I will not live without him. Oh, if
you knew what it was to love.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head sorrowfully. Was it unnatural
that I should pity her, even though she
was my father&#8217;s persecutor? Before I could
speak to her Bruce was by our side. He had
come a few steps to meet us. He held my
hands tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt sure that you would be coming by
this train,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have the tickets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming with you, of course,&#8221; he answered,
turning round and walking by my side.</p>

<p>Olive Berdenstein was watching him eagerly.
He had not taken the slightest notice of her.
A faint flush, which had stolen into her face,<a class="page" name="Page_295" id="Page_295" title="295"></a>
faded slowly away. She became deadly white;
she moved apart and entered the booking office.
As she stood taking her ticket I caught a backward
glance from her dark eyes which made me
shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak to her?&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; he answered, coolly. &#8220;She
is doing her utmost to bring ruin upon you.
She is our enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If yours, mine,&#8221; he declared, smiling down
upon me. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even now she is willing to make terms,&#8221; I
said, slowly, with my eyes fixed upon the approaching
train. &#8220;She is willing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To spare us, if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will give me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that was all over and done with,&#8221;
he protested. &#8220;No one but a couple of girls
could have hatched such a plot. I presumed you
were not going to make any further suggestions
of the sort seriously?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have never been quite sure whether I had
intended to or not. At any rate, his words and
expression then convinced me of the utter hopelessness
of such an attempt. The train drew
up, and he placed me in an empty carriage. He<a class="page" name="Page_296" id="Page_296" title="296"></a>
spoke to the guard and then followed me in.
The door was locked. Olive Berdenstein
walked slowly by and looked into our compartment.
I believe she had meant to travel to
London with us, but if so her design was frustrated.
For the present, at any rate, we were
safe from her.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival we took a hansom and
drove straight to Victoria Street. My mother
was out. We waited impatiently for several
hours. She did not return till dusk. Then I
told her everything. As she listened to me her
face grew white and anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him better than any one else in
the world,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You alone can solve the
mystery of his second life. In this letter he
speaks of it. Whatever it may be, he has gone
back to it now. I want to find him. I must
find him. Can&#8217;t you suggest something that
may help me? If you were not in his whole
confidence, at least you must have some idea
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly and doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only knew,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that there was a
second life. I knew that it was there, but I
had no knowledge of it. If I could help you I
would not hesitate for a single moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, like an inspiration, there flashed into
my mind the thought of that man&#8217;s face whom
I had met in the East End of this great city.<a class="page" name="Page_297" id="Page_297" title="297"></a>
They had persuaded me into a sort of half belief
that I had been mistaken. They were
wrong, and I had been right! I remembered
his strange apparel and his stern avoidance of
me. I had no more doubts. Somewhere in
those regions lay that second life of his. I
sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where he is,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>They both followed me from the house, and
at my bidding Bruce called for a cab. On the
way I told them what had become my conviction.
When I had finished my mother looked
up thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Of course, it
may be no good, but let us try Colville Hall.
It is quite close to the place where you say you
saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colville Hall?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;What sort of
place is that? The name sounds familiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see for yourself,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;It is close here. I will tell the man to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were in the thick of the East End, when
the cab pulled up in front of a large square
building, brilliantly illuminated. Great placards
were posted upon the walls, and a constant
stream of men and women were passing
through the wide open doors. Bruce elbowed
a way for us through the crowd, and we found
ourselves at last wedged in amongst them, irresistibly
carried along into the interior of the<a class="page" name="Page_298" id="Page_298" title="298"></a>
great hall. We passed the threshold in a minute
or two. Then we paused to take breath. I
looked around me with a throb of eager curiosity.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight. The room was
packed with a huge audience, mostly of men
and boys. Nearly all had pipes in their mouths,
and the atmosphere of the place was blue with
smoke. On a raised platform at the further
end several men were sitting, also smoking, and
then, with a sudden, swift shock of surprise, I
realized that our search was indeed over. One
of them was my father, coarsely and poorly
dressed, and holding between his fingers a
small briar pipe.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the motley assemblage, the
silence in the hall was intense. There were
very few women there, and they, as well as the
men, appeared to be of the lowest order. Their
faces were all turned expectantly towards the
platform. One or two of them were whispering
amongst themselves, but my father&#8217;s voice&mdash;he
had risen to his feet now&mdash;sounded clear
and distinct above the faint murmuring&mdash;we
too, held our breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I am glad to
see so many of you here to-night. I have come
a long way to have my last talk with you. Partings
are always sad things, and I shall feel very
strange when I leave this hall to-night, to know<a class="page" name="Page_299" id="Page_299" title="299"></a>
that in all human probability I shall never set
foot in it again. But our ways are made for
us, and all that we can do is to accept them
cheerfully. To-night, my friends, it is for us to
say farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something of the sort seemed to have been
expected, yet there were a good many concerned
and startled faces; a little half-protesting,
half-kindly murmur of negation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gar on! You&#8217;re not a-going to leave us,
gov-nor!&#8221;</p>

<p>My father shook his head, smiling faintly.
Notwithstanding his rough attire, the delicacy
of his figure and the statuesque beauty of his
calm, pale face were distinctly noticeable. With
an irresistible effort of memory I seemed to see
once more the great cathedral, with its dim,
solemn hush, the shadows around the pillars,
and the brilliantly lit chancel, a little oasis of
light shining through the gloom. The perfume
of the flowers, and the soft throbbing music of
the great organ seemed to be floating about on
the thick, noxious air. Then my father, his
hand pressed to his side, and his face soft with
a wonderful tenderness, commenced his farewell
address to these strange looking people.</p>

<p>Very soon I had forgotten where I was. My
eyes were wet with tears, and my heart was
aching with a new pain. The gentle, kindly,
eloquence, the wan face, with its irresistible<a class="page" name="Page_300" id="Page_300" title="300"></a>
sweet smile, so human, so marvellously sympathetic,
was a revelation to me. It was a farewell
to a people with whom he must have been
brought into vivid and personal communion, a
message of farewell, too, to others of them who
were not there. It was a sermon&mdash;did they
think of it as a sermon, I wonder?&mdash;to the like
of which I had certainly never listened before,
which seemed to tell between the lines as
though with a definite purpose the story of his
own sorrows and his own sins. In that great
hall there was no sound, save those slow words
vibrating with nervous force, which seemed
each one of them to leave him palpably the
weaker. Some let their pipes go out, others
smoked stolidly on, with their faces steadfastly
fixed upon that thin, swaying figure. The secret
of his long struggle with them and his
tardy victory seemed to become revealed to us
in their attitude towards him and their reverent
silence. One forgot all about their unwashed
faces and miserable attire, the foul tobacco
smoke, and the hard, unsexed-looking women
who listened with bowed heads as though
ashamed to display a very unusual emotion.
One remembered only that the place was holy.</p>

<p>The words of farewell were spoken at last.
He did not openly speak of death, yet I doubt
whether there was one of them who did not
divine it. He stood upon the little platform<a class="page" name="Page_301" id="Page_301" title="301"></a>
holding out his hands towards them, and they
left their places in orderly fashion, yet jealously
eager to be amongst the first to clasp them,
and somehow we three felt that it was no place
for us, and we made our way out again on to
the pavement. My mother and I looked at one
another with wet eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, then,&#8221; I murmured, &#8220;we know his
secret. Would to God that we had known before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; my mother answered, &#8220;that
he has escaped recognition. There has been so
much written about this place lately. Only last
week I was asked to come here. Every one has
been talking about the marvellous influence he
has gained over these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>We waited there for him. In little groups the
congregation came slowly out and dispersed.
The lights in the main body of the building
were extinguished. Still he did not come. We
were on the point of seeking for a side entrance
when a man came hurriedly out of the darkened
building and commenced running up the
street. Something seemed to tell me the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man has gone for a doctor,&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;See, he has stopped at the house with the red
lamp. He is ill! I am going inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried the door. It opened at my touch and
we groped our way across the unlit room, bare
and desolate enough now with its rows of empty<a class="page" name="Page_302" id="Page_302" title="302"></a>
and disarranged chairs, and with little clouds of
dense tobacco smoke still hanging about. In a
little recess behind the platform we found my
father. One man&mdash;a cabman he seemed to be&mdash;was
holding his hand, another was supporting
his head. When he saw us he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;God is very good,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;There
was nothing I wished for but to see you once
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dropped on my knees by his side. There
was a mist before my eyes and a great lump in
my throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are worse,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Have they sent
for a doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the end,&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;It will all
be over very soon now. I am ready. My work
here was commenced. It is not granted to any
one to do more than to make commencements.
Give&mdash;give&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flutter of a gown close at hand disturbed
me. I followed my father&#8217;s eyes. Olive Berdenstein
had glided from a dark corner underneath
one of the galleries, and was coming like
a wraith towards us. I half rose to my feet in
a fit of passionate anger. Bruce, too, had taken
a hasty step towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see you are too late?&#8221; he whispered
to her hoarsely. &#8220;Go away from here.
It is no place for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; she murmured, softly, and then<a class="page" name="Page_303" id="Page_303" title="303"></a>
the sound of heavy footsteps coming up the hall
made us all look round and my heart died away
within me. Two men in plain clothes were
within a few yards of us; a policeman followed
close behind. My father closed his eyes, and
from the look of horror in his face I knew how
he had dreaded this thing. One of the men
advanced to Olive Berdenstein, and touched his
hat. I can hear her voice now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Mr. Smith,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have
made a mistake. This is not the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for a minute or two,
and then a little murmur of voices which
reached me as though from a great distance. I
heard the sound of their retreating footsteps. I
caught a glimpse of Olive Berdenstein&#8217;s tear-stained
face as she bent for a moment over my
father&#8217;s prostrate figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she followed them out of the hall, and
we none of us saw her any more. But there
was a light in my father&#8217;s face like the light
which is kindled by a great joy. One hand I
kept, the other my mother clasped. He looked
up at us and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is happiness.&#8221;</p>
